The row follows days of infighting over Sir Keir's decision to withhold the Parliamentary whip from Mr Corbyn, with Mr Murray one of various Left-wing figures to criticise the decision. Mr Corbyn, who has been suspended for three months, has been issued with an ultimatum stating that he must \"unequivocally\" apologise for saying the scale of anti-Semitism in the party had been \"overstated\". At a meeting held virtually on Tuesday morning, several members of the party's national executive committee (NEC) had argued that as serving vice-chairman Mr Murray should be automatically promoted to the role of chairman.",

            "It may never be known whether Donald Trump truly believed he won the 2020 US election, or if the last two weeks have been an extended face-saving exercise. Some senior Republicans, who have remained publicly silent, viewed the president's legal assault on the electoral system as akin to a tantrum, or to him working through the various stages of grief. Whatever his motivation, the president's decision on Monday to accept the formal transition process marked the end of an extraordinary interregnum. It began on Nov 7 when all major US television networks \"called\" the election for Joe Biden. At this point, it is traditional for one candidate to concede, although it is simply a custom. Instead, Mr Trump began making allegations of widespread voter fraud, and assembled a legal team to overturn counts in various battleground states. Three dozen cases were filed in six states. The vast majority were rejected by a judge, or withdrawn. Not a single case of voter fraud was upheld by a court. One legal expert described the strategy as like \"throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks, which I tell my law students is never a good strategy.\" Mr Trump became increasingly frustrated with his legal team. But the frustration went both ways, and several lawyers withdrew from representing him in court. Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's personal lawyer, seized control. His all-out attack culminated in a bizarre, hour-long press conference on Nov 19. The claims Mr Giuliani made about voter fraud were overshadowed when black hair dye rolled down his cheeks. At the same event Sidney Powell, another firebrand lawyer, made claims including that voting software had been created at the direction of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. Mr Giuliani later distanced himself from her, saying Ms Powell was \"not a member of the Trump Legal Team\". Then, on Monday, a number of things collided to force Mr Trump's hand. Rush Limbaugh, the massively popular conservative radio talk show host, and friend of the president, issued a rare attack.",

But when I was asked to try the blendSMART2 Powered Makeup Brush ($69), I was totally intrigued. I have seen the motorized brush all over Instagram and Facebook, but I wanted to find out if it's truly worth the hype. I went all out and tested the blendSMART Holiday Glow Kit ($98), which includes three different brush heads. I opted for the foundation brush so I could see how well it worked the product into my skin. The assembly is easy; all you have to do is insert the included battery, then pop on the brush head of your choice. My foundation has honestly never looked better; it melted into my pores and fully covered my blemishes in a way I have never seen.  I followed the directions on how to apply product, and I have to say, I was blown away. My foundation has honestly never looked better; it melted into my pores and fully covered my blemishes in a way I have never seen. I have used the brush every single day since receiving it, and I am still loving it. My sponge is collecting dust in my makeup bag.

            "Leading figures from the world of rugby union paid tribute on Tuesday to the former France international Christophe Dominici who died on Tuesday at the age of 48. Dominici, who was found at the foot of a building in a car park on the outskirts of Paris, scored 25 tries in 67 Tests for France, including eight tries across three World Cups.After starting out with his home-town club Toulon in the south of France, he moved to Paris-based Stade Francais with whom he won the French championship five times between 1998 and 2007.\u201cThe French rugby family is in mourning after the tragic death of our winger Christophe Dominici, said the French Rugby Federation (FFR) in a tweet. \u201cWe are thinking especially of his family and loved ones.\u201d\"Deeply saddened to hear of Christophe Dominici's passing. tweeted Bill Beaumont, chairman of World Rugby.\"He was a star of 1999 @rugbyworldcup scoring a brilliant try in that thrilling semi-final & you had the feeling that something special would happen every time he took to the field.\u201dSkillsDominici was renowned as a winger for his balance and a deceptive change of pace. He orchestrated one of the most fabled tries and comebacks in World Cup legend.On 31\u00a0October 1999, during the semi-final against the reigning champions New Zealand, he breezed between two opponents to grab a bouncing ball one-handed before blazing\u00a0down the left touchline.His try put the French ahead for the first time as they overturned a 14-point deficit to reach the final.\u00a0The score also helped to incarnate the dreamy concept of 'French flair'.The FFR described Dominici as a legend and an emblematic player who had\u00a0left his imprint on an entire generation of rugby.'Rugby genius'Former Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, who faced Dominici several times on the field, tweeted: \"Very sad to hear of the sudden passing of Christophe Dominici. A French player full of flair with huge success throughout his career. May he RIP.\"Dominici's\u00a0former club, Stade Francais, described him as a rugby genius and peerless companion. The club added:\u00a0\"He leaves a great void in our big family.\"\u00a0After he retired in 2008, the then-national coach Bernard Laporte gave him a coaching role. He also worked as a media pundit.Away from the sport,\u00a0Dominici said he suffered bouts of depression. In his 2007 autobiography, he admitted a personal loss had triggered depression and that he had been abused as a child.\u00a0\u201cTo me, classic French rugby meant ugly brutes up front and dashing cavaliers in the backs,\u201d tweeted\u00a0fan John Mulcahy.\u201cChristophe was the epitome of the latter - a joy to watch - we mostly never know the real person - I hope he was a good guy - he certainly brought pleasure to millions - RIP.\u201d",

            "BMX is a sport in which you can perform a wide variety of\nstunts. We\u2019ve seen other people do it, and we have tried to replicate it over\nmany hours of practice. They\u2019re tough to achieve, but once we get it right, we realize\nit was worth it.",
            "It is not easy. Like any other sport, practice is what makes the master. We only need the proper instructions, the best BMX bike on the market, and our safety equipment to avoid accidents.",
            "If you\u2019ve got everything ready, then it is time for us to\ntalk about the most popular BMX tricks, what you need to do them successfully,\nand all the preparation they require.",
            "Before we even attempt to do any stunt, it is important to have the proper safety equipment to protect us. We\u2019re going to fall many times before mastering certain tricks, and the last thing we need is hurting our body.",
            "The first thing you\u2019ll need is a proper helmet. It will keep\nus from hurting our head, which is very important to avoid concussions or even\nbrain damage. Yes, I know it sounds a bit too extreme, but there is never\nenough precaution when our health is on the line.",
            "We should not take the BMX sport lightly either. The first\nrule to practicing any extreme sport is to understand they are dangerous. As\nlong as we respect the sport, we\u2019ll have a better comprehension of how\ndangerous it is.",
            "Nonetheless, you should always wear a helmet. A good helmet keeps your head secured, and you can customize it as well. Adjusting the helmet to your style is quite satisfying.",
            "Most of the stunts you\u2019ll do with BMX require complete use\nof your limbs. You will need to use the strength of your arms to lift the bike,\nbut most tricks also need us to use our legs to apply pressure.",
            "The pads for both elbows and knees ensure your joints don\u2019t\nsuffer from nasty impacts.",
            "Plenty of manufacturers sell these pads in a set. They feature a similar design, with the brand\u2019s colors and unique characteristics. Because of that, you don\u2019t have to worry about equipment that doesn\u2019t match.",
            "Of course, we\u2019re going to need a proper BMX bike as well. We\nmust remember that there are many types of bikes, which could confuse people,\nespecially when we\u2019re beginners.",
            "For instance, we can find bikes like the Schwinn bikes. These\nbikes fall in the BMX category, and they\u2019re good, but they are not what you\nwant if you need to perform high-quality stunts.\n\nYou want to buy a bike with a solid frame\nstructure, with abuse-resistant tires, quality pedals, and great parts. Only\nthe best BMX bikes are capable of performing the stunts we want to do.",
            "Now that you\u2019ve got everything set to go, there are a couple of tricks we want to advise you trying. These tricks take some time, but if you practice them regularly, you\u2019re going to master them quickly.",
            "The J-Hop is one of the most common tricks for BMX bike riders. To do it, you must pull up your front tire and lean back. Once the front wheel is at a considerable height, you want to put pressure on the back wheel and pull up.",
            "This trick is perfect for park areas. You must drive straight forward to the transition. Here, you must perform a J-Hop and turn your bike in any direction you want, completing a 90 degrees turn. At the top of the transition, you want to hold the bike in its place and hop 90 degrees back.",
            "The disaster is a park trick as well. Riding right to the front of the transition, you must J-Hop at the top, and perform a 180 degrees spin. As soon as you hit the ground, make sure the front wheel is in, and then hop back again.",
            "The Fakie Out might seem very simple, but it\u2019d amaze you the\namount of focus and effort it requires. To do it, you have to roll back and\npedal backward at the same time. Then, do a quick turn to gain a straight\nposition and continue riding.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Performing awesome stunts requires time, effort, and\nself-awareness. Before we master our technique, we\u2019re going to fall constantly,\nwhich is why you should always have the proper preparation, and the safety\nmeasures this sport demands."

            "Ok this is my instructable about your basic bike tricks, so far I'm covering:*Slides*Wheelies*Stoppies or Endos*Bunnyhops*Jumping*Other bits and pieces.This instructable is likely to be added to from time to time, however since I had such a good day today I wanted to get photos and start writing away...Written as a follow up to My guide to urban cyclingAlso this is entered in the Bike month contest, please do vote or rate this 'ible if you like it...Another Also, it is best advised to wear a helmet for cycling,  was being naughty and arrogant by not, even though most of these were performed at low speed, to help the camera, I know I have no excuse at all for the jumping and I would like to make it clear that a helmet is the most important accesory a person can have for their bicycle...",
            "Ok we're starting with the most basic showing off you can do, alway fun on loose ground and wet days, also it's the easiest trick to pull off. \rBasically the plan is to lock the back wheel up and get the back end to step out by turning like that so. \rGoing at moderate speed on loose ground or on wet ground, you can do it on any surface but it'll wreck your tyres... \rSee a turn you'd like to slide around...\rPull the back brake hard, once the wheel locks up you'r e free to turn whenever...\rWhen you're turning allow the end to step out and if you get uncomfortable you simply let go of the brake and go on as normal. \rYou can either skid to a halt or slide around a turn and let off the back brake and continue on.\rIf you don't know this one already you can get more comfortable by starting on slippy ground and just going at medium speed, lock the back wheel and make small turning movements to get used to the feeling of it.  \rOnce you get better you can start fishtailing etc. this is where you add turns in the opposite direction to eachother and swing the end about.\rSliding can come in handy in lots of situations, on forest trails when you seriously misjudge a turn sliding around it at high speed can be alot easier than attempting to brake and turn with the front which leads to washing out... \rIf you go too low and start to fall you can kick the ground with the inside leg to lean up or just drop down and slide to a halt, in most cases I find falling from a badly judged slide far less painful than when you wash out.",
            "This is an easy trick again, the objective being to lift the front wheel in to the air by pedalling hard and leaning back...Ok so select a lowish gear, like 2nd and 2nd or 3rd and 1st  On a fixie you have no choice and on a bike with a single derailleur I'd say 1st or 2nd.Now If you want to do a high angle wheelie that wont hold for as long but is easier to do with less falling off pains I'd suggest doing them standing up.For a wheelie you can hold for longer and travel with sitting down is better. So start moving slowly and get ready... When you feel good to go, pedal hard while pulling up on the handlebars and leaning back a bit, if you're standing and go too high simply hop off on to your feet. So if you're having trouble lifting up, take a gear lower than before and work on timing, naturally if you pedal down hard all of a sudden the front end will lift, you need to combine this with leaning back and lifting the handlebars. Don't let your front wheel turn sideways more than a few degrees, otherwise when you land you'll be bucked off the bike.",
            "This trick is about getting the back wheel off the ground by using your weight and the front brake, it's a little scarier than doing a wheelie but in reality much easier... \rFor this one you're best learning at lower speed and building up the big angles. \rSo coming along at a speed you're comfortable at, standing preferably to avoid the seat invading you when you come back down. \rPull the front brake in and slowly pull harder while leaning forward a bit, once slow enough to try tipping up lock the wheel and lean in a bit, no too much or you'll fall off the bike before it tips over anyway. \rAt any point let go of the brake or lean back to stop tipping forward.\rIf you go too far forward jump off the pedals and let go of the brake, let your feet land nearer the front wheel, if you forget to let go of the brake the back end will attempt to cut your leg off, not particularly painful but not pleasant. \rSo coming up start braking and when you're happy yank the brake and lean in, after a certain point where you feel like you're going face first, straighten your body a bit and that will slow you faceward progress... \rjust build up the speeds you do it at until you get it the way you like.\rOnce you get more skilled you can start turning around during endos I'm quite close to straight in this photo though urges are hard to resist...",
            "This one is a culmination of the leaning and lifting you learn from doing wheelies, also some people know it as a 'horse hop'.In this the objective is to jump both wheels off the ground. This is done by lifting the front of the bike up like a wheelie and then lifting the back to level.So coming at any speed you're happy with.Take a curb or something, to get used to the movements jumping off or over something is easier. When you come to the obstacle lift the front wheel up.***A far better explanation from ledzeppie, who also like his bikes... push your bars forward... i lean back like **** and once my front wheel is high enough I throw my body up and push forward on my handlebars and that will level my bike out... i suggest learning these on speed bumps. Make sure you have still got 'landing room' for your giblets, this applies to girlies aswell, that bike seat hurts either way. once you master this it becomes a natural thing and is great for hopping curbs at speed instead of worrying about blowing the rear tyre...I have to apologize for the bad photos in this step, try as we might we couldn't get a good mid-bunnyhop photo, I'll get the SLR and a helper and get it done soon. The first one shows me starting to take off, the second is of the 'lift' portion of the trick.",
            "So jumping, this involves most of the elements of a bunnyhop but without the work of removing yourself from the ground...\rSo coming up to your jump in question, speed is dependant completely on how high and far you'd like to go, start with ramp jumps or even sloped curbs, just to get used to the ideas involved, rather than land in a ditch... \rSo coming up to your jump at a speed you're comfortable with.\rAs you come off your jump, lift your legs in a bit and bring the bike to lean backward a bit, this give you a more stable position for both landing and 'flying' \rWhen landing keep your legs bent, as you come in make sure the front wheel is straight. \rOnce you've landed on hard ground again you'll usually realise that jumping is not difficult as it's quite a natural maneuvre... \rIn the picture I'm actually shifting gears as I jump, the second one shows more landing...",
            "Trackstands:\rThese aren't hard, to start with practice by going very slow and keeping your balance until you can do it with minimal turning of the handlebars.  Find a slight slope, now the idea here is not to try and keep super still but to use your back brake and pedals to rock back and forth with the handlebars turned slightly to keep your balance, handy for lots of things, one of which is muddy places, means you don't need to keep slipping on your pedals later on...\rDismounting:\rI like to dismount both with a little grace and in a way that involves minimum effort, my favourite is definitely coming along and swinging one leg over the bike so I'm standing on one pedal and my other leg is tucked in behind me, start with both hands on the handlebars, you need to lean in to keep your balance, eventually you can get this by leaning over the bike with one hand and one foot, which is cool for saluting people and whatnot.\rFuture additions:\rWell anything you'd like to see in here please do comment me or PM with requests, I'm sure there are tricks I'd know and others I'd like to learn.\rComing soon, ledzeppie's 'ible on more advanced tricks on you bike.\rAnother coming soon will be my more advanced 'ible, with some help from prometheus...",

The 20-year-old has a back injury that prevented him from competing, but he still appears to be in the center of the action: He\u2019s the timing official for the event, as well as an occasional emcee.",

            "Bao is a linchpin of China\u2019s nascent BMX community. He\u2019s a silver medalist at this year\u2019s freestyle national championships and a tireless promoter of the sport through the Shanghai-based club Cat Crew, his social media channels, and his youth coaching. But when he joins up with China\u2019s national BMX team, Bao confesses to feeling more like an outsider.",

            "\u201cTraining with the (national) team is more regimented,\u201d Bao tells Sixth Tone.",
            "Ever since the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that BMX freestyle park would be an official event at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, China\u2019s sports authorities have been attempting to integrate the country\u2019s top freestylers into its elite sports training system. The process, however, has been fraught at times, as free spirits like Bao struggle to adapt to the military-style discipline required of athletes representing Team China.",
            "",
            "The Chinese sports bureaucracy swung into action as soon as the IOC announcement was made in 2017. BMX is a new, niche pastime in China, but within months, authorities drew up a plan to train more than 1,000 riders nationwide, with 27 Chinese provinces establishing their own BMX freestyle teams. Twenty-four crack freestylers \u2014 10 male and 14 female \u2014 would then be selected for a national squad to begin intensive training during the second half of 2018.",
            "As with most Olympic events, the chosen athletes were mainly students from China\u2019s network of specialist sports schools, which have provided more than 90% of Chinese Olympic medal winners since 2004. But the squad also included six independent freestylers, including Bao.",
            "Bao\u2019s background contrasts sharply with those of his sports school teammates, who began rigorous athletic training at a young age but have little riding experience, having been reassigned from other sports in 2017.",
            "A native of the southwestern city of Chengdu, Bao dropped out of middle school in his early teens and worked a string of blue-collar jobs washing cars, scrubbing pots, and hawking drinks. Discovering BMX in 2014 helped him turn his life around, he says.",
            "Bao Jiafu rests at the Cat Crew BMX bike shop in Shanghai, Nov. 12, 2019. Jiang Feng for Sixth Tone",

            "\u201cRiding BMX made me feel less confused about life,\u201d says Bao. \u201cI could release my negative emotions.\u201d",
            "Bao bought his first real BMX bike at age 15. The bicycle cost 1,100 yuan (then $180) \u2014 two-thirds of his monthly salary at the time. \u201cI thought it must be excellent,\u201d says Bao, though he later discovered it was the cheapest model on the market. From then on, he dedicated himself completely to freestyle BMX, spending all his spare time practicing tricks.",
            "Zhao Qiang, a Shanghai-based freestyler who now also serves as Bao\u2019s agent, recalls being amazed by Bao\u2019s work ethic when he first met him at a BMX show in 2016.",
            "\u201cHe practiced so hard,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cThat\u2019s why he made quick progress. He dreamed of being a professional rider.\u201d",

            "At the time, nobody thought it was possible to make a living from BMX in China, but Bao eventually proved them wrong. He took part in BMX freestyle performances and traveled to competitions across the country, winning prize money and ultimately attracting sponsorship deals.",
            "\u201c(At first,) he didn\u2019t even know whether he could afford the next tournament trip, but he kept doing it anyway,\u201d says Zhao.",
            "Despite his intense ambition and self-motivation, however, Bao confesses to finding the national team training \u201ctiring.\u201d Life in the boot camps is highly structured, with athletes required to rise at 7 a.m. and start working out by 8 a.m. Training usually lasts until 9 p.m., sometimes later. The atmosphere was a far cry from the carefree vibe at Cat Crew, Bao\u2019s club.",
            "The freestyler also chafed against the scientific approach to training that prevailed in the camps. In the eyes of the sports officials, BMX freestyle park is similar to events like gymnastics or diving, in which athletes are required to perform a series of challenging moves flawlessly. Coaches from those sports were integrated into the BMX camps and applied similar training techniques designed to help athletes improve their posture and achieve greater hang time.",
            "A rider plays with a feline friend at the Cat Crew BMX bike shop in Shanghai, Nov. 12, 2019. Jiang Feng for Sixth Tone",
            "",
            "For the Cat Crew members, though this style of training is probably effective in terms of winning Olympic medals, it strays from the true spirit of BMX.",
            "\u201cPlanning your own practice is different from being assigned all these training tasks,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cI know what I want to practice and I plan for myself \u2014 that\u2019s how I\u2019m different from the sports school kids,\u201d adds Bao.",
            "The performance of China\u2019s BMX team in recent competitions suggests the training has not had the impact officials hoped. In the 2018 UCI BMX Freestyle Park World Cup, the highest-ranked male Chinese rider finished 124th out of 167 competitors, with China occupying six of the bottom eight positions. The women\u2019s team fared little better, with China\u2019s top rider finishing 36th in a field of 47. With just over five months of the Olympic qualification process to go, Team China\u2019s hopes of sending riders to Tokyo appear slim.",
            "Wu Zhipeng, a BMX coach based in southern Guangdong province, says the training camps have failed to get the best from the team. Sports school athletes sometimes lack passion for BMX, while experienced freestylers like Bao can feel out of place.",
            "Wu Zhipeng practices in Dongguang, Guangdong province, 2017. From Wu\u2019s Weibo",
            "",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the facilities where you practice,\u201d says Wu. \u201cThe kind of people you are practicing with also matters.\u201d",
            "In truth, Tokyo 2020 may have come too early for Team China. Wu points out that elite riders would normally begin training at 10-14 years old, and so sports schools may produce a better crop of freestylers for the next Olympics. At the moment, sports officials are playing the odds by focusing their resources on women\u2019s BMX, where competition is believed to be less fierce, according to Bao.",
            "\u201cThere are great hopes for Chinese female BMX freestylers to qualify for the Olympics,\u201d says Bao.",
            "Yet some argue China should do more than focus on training up a small squad of elite athletes. Efforts could also be made to grow the sport and get kids on their bikes.",
            "Passionate freestylers like Bao remain extremely rare in China. The first Chinese freestyle rider, Guo Yaokun, started practicing tricks only in the 1990s, and there are still just 300 active freestyle riders in the country, according to Sylvain Aubichon, a Shanghai-based BMX coach.",
            "",
            "Many Chinese parents are reluctant to let their children take up BMX, perceiving it as dangerous and rebellious, says Ding Yiyin, a researcher at Hangzhou Normal University who focuses on social attitudes toward extreme sports. Videos of tattooed riders drinking liquor to gain courage before attempting a hazardous trick periodically scandalize users on Chinese social media platforms.",
            "\u201cDue to their limited knowledge and stereotypes toward extreme sports \u2026 (lots of parents believe BMX freestyle) is more dangerous than it really is,\u201d says Ding.",
            "The few youngsters who do take up the sport, meanwhile, struggle to find space to practice in China\u2019s crowded cities. Public skate parks are few and far between, and are often overrun by small children. Professional-standard parks are even rarer: There are only two in Shanghai, a city of 24 million people. For elite riders, the lack of facilities is a problem.",
            "\u201cOnly rookies ride in public skate parks,\u201d says Zhao, Bao\u2019s agent.",
            "Thanks to the efforts of high-profile freestylers like Bao, however, there are signs that BMX is slowly starting to gather momentum in China. The Chengdu native, with his cheeky smile and inspiring backstory, is helping to create a new, friendlier image for the sport.",
            "\u201cBao is the one with a positive image in the community that challenges the mainstream\u2019s misperception of street riders,\u201d says Ding.",
            "Bao\u2019s ability to attract support from famous brands including Vans, Le Coq Sportif, and New Era is also convincing people that freestyling is a potential path to success. Before, even Bao\u2019s own parents considered BMX a waste of time, but now their attitude has changed. \u201cThey think I have a decent job,\u201d he says.",

            "Today, Bao runs regular classes for children in several cities, teaching them to ride on indoor mini ramps. His students like him so much, they often escort him to the railway station to wave goodbye as he heads back to Shanghai.",
            "\u201cI wish they (my students) could grow up sooner,\u201d says Bao. \u201cThen, I could sit by the skate park and watch them ride.\u201d",
            "Whether the sport\u2019s growing popularity will help China in its quest for Olympic BMX glory remains to be seen. Wu, the Guangdong-based coach, feels the gap between the Chinese riders and the world\u2019s top freestylers is too wide to bridge anytime soon. Zhao, however, thinks that Chinese BMX may be on the cusp of something big.",
            "\u201cAcceptance for our sport is growing,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cThis is no longer a generation that resists sports that might cause trouble.\u201d",

Let your body weight roll forward as the back end lifts. The key is control: Too much brake and you pile-drive yourself, too little and you just slow down. Don\u2019t lock up the front wheel; let it keep rolling. Done perfectly, you\u2019ll stop just as your weight reaches the balance point. Hold for a second, and enjoy the cheers.",
            "Difficulty: 2-4 (depending on the hill)Dazzle Your Buds: While your friends push, you jump back on and pedal up, up and away.How It\u2019s Done: Shift 1-3 gears harder than when you stopped. Position your bike for the best traction and line. Clip in your strong foot with the crank at 2 o\u2019clock. If possible, place your unclipped foot on a rock or log so you can sit on the saddle. Bend your elbows and lower your chest toward the stem, so you\u2019re in position. Then, in one motion, push off with your free foot, push down with the clipped-in foot and sit in the saddle. Build momentum, then clip in your free foot. If the front end lifts, shift up a gear, lower your chest and slide forward on the saddle. If you spin out, shift to a harder gear, lift your chest and slide back on the saddle.",
            "Difficulty: 2 (staying centered is key)Dazzle Your Buds: Fool your road-ride group into thinking you hit asphalt. You\u2019re so funny!How It\u2019s Done: Drift to the back and let a bike-length gap open. For control, put your hands in the drops, or, on a flat bar, centered on your grips. Clip out with your dominant foot and drop your clipped-in foot to 6 o\u2019clock. Then rest the thigh that belongs to the clipped-in foot on the top tube and, while keeping your bike centered, lightly scrape the cleat on your clipped-out foot along the pavement.

Hold onto the center of the bar with your left hand; with your right, roll down your shorts, relax and have at it, keeping an eye out for road obstacles.

Use flat pedals for easy escape, or don\u2019t clip in. Pedal in a low or medium gear, then push down on one crank while pulling up on your handlebar. Slide back on the saddle so your weight is over the rear wheel. You\u2019re up. Once that\u2019s easy, pop up and keep pedaling, using your rear brake for control.",

Ride to one side of the object, as close to it as possible without touching it. Just as the part of the front tire in contact with the trail passes the object, slightly unweight the front end of your bike and flick the handlebar toward the object, in one smooth motion. Lift too much and the wheel rolls over the target; lift too little and you\u2019ll end up in the bushes as the front tire grabs and darts to the side.

Scoot your butt off the back of the seat until your stomach and/or chest are on it. Unclip from the pedals, supporting your weight on your chest, and lift your legs out behind you until you\u2019re flying like the Man of Steel. Your more-aero position should shoot you past the pack. The return to Clark Kent status is much harder. Bring your feet back to the pedals; don\u2019t clip in, just stand up and scoot your butt forward.

            "Before you start practising, you should work towards physical fitness so that your body does not go into shock when you attempt to do the tricks. You should consider doing",
            "exercises for flexibility before you go on a riding spree.",
            "Some of the tricks you that BMX riders enjoy include:",
            "In this trick, you will basically be jumping onto or over a ramp. To do this, you will coil while pulling the handlebars towards your chest. When the front wheel is off the ground, you should push the handlebars forward and pull up your knees so that the back wheels are close to your buttocks.",
            "This is considered one of the easiest grinds to land. To do this, you will be jumping over a ledge or rail and then land on pegs that are attached to the rear and front axles of the bike. The forward momentum will get you sliding on the rail.",
            "This can easily be executed by amateurs. To do this, you will need to pull up on your bike and then lean back. When the front tyre has gotten to the height you think you can manage, push forward so that your back tyre can go up. When both tyres are up in the air, you pull the bike towards you so that you can reach the full height.",
            "This trick is best done in a park. To do this, you should ride straight till you reach the transition. From there, you jay-hop and turn your bicycle to a 90 degree angle to face wherever you want it to go. When the tires get to the top of transition, hold the bike into place and do a 900 degrees hop back in.",
            "This is considered by many riders as one of the most interesting maneuver to master. To do this, you will go up on a jump or incline then use one of your foot to pivot to a 180 degrees angle. This will enable you to go down the ramp. Basically, the foot plant can be summarized a bunny hop on a ramp where you use your foot to get some extra support.",
            "The fakie involves you riding your bike in reverse. You whip your front wheel at a very fast speed, and then start riding forward. It is one of the most common tricks used by professional riders.",
            "If you are just starting out riding, you should know that there are many tricks in riding your BMX and it takes patience and practise to master them all. Always remember that even as you seek the thrill, your safety comes first. Wear protective attire at all times when attempting a trick.",

            "Luscious green trees surround the outdoor skatepark and grandstands at the UCI Urban Cycling World Championships in Chengdu, China. Freestyle BMX star Hannah Roberts \u2014 atop her pink bike, rocking a black full-face helmet \u2014 drops in and pedals hard toward a spine ramp. As she launches off the ramp, Roberts begins a 360-degree spin. In the middle of her rotation, she uses the handlebars to whip the bike around separate from her body, becoming the first woman to land a 360 tailwhip in competition.",
            "The historic trick, thrown down on her sport\u2019s biggest stage, epitomized Roberts\u2019 young career. She has never stopped building to bigger and better things.",
            "Rather than give the crowd a fist pump, or take a breather to soak in the momentous occasion, Roberts immediately hits a vert ramp and busts a flair \u2014 a backflip with a simultaneous 180-degree turn.",
            "The year before, she took a disappointing third in the event, behind fellow Americans Perris Benegas and Angie Marino. On Nov. 10, 2019, Roberts avenged the loss, winning her second world championship at just 18 years old with a score of 90.0 out of 100.",
            "After wiping away tears, she stood above the rest on the podium, smiling as she accepted a gold medal and a stuffed panda with a leaf in its mouth. She wore UCI\u2019s iconic rainbow jersey, bestowed upon world champions of every cycling discipline since the 1920s.",
            "Just one week earlier, she had won her fourth straight FISE World Cups Series, which also held its final event in Chengdu. Roberts left no question whether she was the best women\u2019s freestyle BMXer in the world.",
            "\u201cI wanted to have the rainbow jersey going into the Olympic year,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cIt was more for myself. I put so much work in, and I was so focused on showing that I wasn\u2019t going to take second or third again. I wanted that year to be all about me, so I threw down some of my bigger tricks.\u201d",
            "Her mother Betty made the trip to Chengdu to watch, after she and Roberts had spent half a year apart. In order to train for the world championships, Roberts effectively emancipated herself from her mother and father in June 2019 while she was still 17.",
            "She moved in with long-time medical trainer Trish Bare Grounds and Trish\u2019s 18-year-old daughter, Olivia, 750 miles away in Holly Springs, North Carolina. As she moved, she changed her diet. More importantly, she strictly budgeted her modest income. Being a teenage action sports prodigy with international acclaim isn\u2019t as lucrative as one might think.",
            "There was no giant check waiting at the podium in Chengdu to signify the \u20ac10,000 in prize money she earned, but the win was huge for Roberts. Just four months prior, she wasn\u2019t sure she could sustain her freestyle BMX career into her mid-twenties unless the sport became more financially stable.",
            "The World Championships are one of the few annual competitions to award equal prizes to men and women. By comparison, when she won the final contest of the world series, the Men\u2019s Elite winner took home \u20ac8,000 while Roberts received \u20ac1,500.",
            "And though Roberts\u2019 accomplishments show how far women\u2019s freestyle BMX has come in recent years in terms of talent and viability, they are also a reminder of the wage and sponsorship gap that persists between male and female athletes. As impressive as Roberts and her peers have been, the most famous annual extreme sports event, the X Games, still won\u2019t let them compete.",
            "The now-postponed summer Olympics were supposed to be a launch pad for the sport and for Roberts. The games drew an estimated 3.6 billion viewers for the Rio Games in 2016. Freestyle BMX will be an event for the first time ever in Tokyo, and Roberts is the clear favorite to take home gold.",
            "\u201cWomen are the future of our sport,\u201d says Nina Buitrago, a pioneer of women\u2019s BMX who continues to be one of the sports biggest advocates. \u201cThey\u2019re very marketable, and it\u2019s a big thing that BMX has needed for a long time. It\u2019s just incredible that with something like the Olympics, it\u2019s catapulted all of us in to try to progress more and just own our journey.\u201d",
            "Roberts is ready to lead the charge; unfortunately, there\u2019s only so much she can control. She did everything right heading into the 2020 games \u2014 kept herself afloat financially, trained relentlessly, won everything she needed to and then some.",
            "But she couldn\u2019t predict the coronavirus pandemic that has put her Olympic dreams, and those of countless others, on hold until 2021 at the earliest. Roberts is used to addressing her problems through sheer willpower. Being forced to wait, a budding star without a showcase, has been an entirely different challenge.",
            "In South Bend, Indiana, around the back of an old brick chocolate factory, past a chain-link gate and barbed-wire fence, and at the other end of a parking lot with cracked concrete, sits an old mattress factory-turned-world-class skatepark. The indoor park known as \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d is closed most weekdays, but on an unusually warm Monday afternoon in February, the front door is unlocked. Roberts is home for the first time in more than six months to enjoy her formative skatepark.",
            "That evening, she will ride with three boys between the ages of 11 and 14 who she has mentored for years. Roberts was invited to the park for a private session for them and their parents. She practically had no choice \u2014 she happened to be in town, and they were blowing up her phone all day begging to celebrate.",
            "The official Team USA Instagram account posted a photo of Roberts earlier that afternoon announcing she was the first American to ever qualify for the Olympics in freestyle BMX.",
            "WATCH OUT,   18-year-old @hannah_roberts_bmx is the first American to qualify for the Olympics in BMX freestyle \u203c\ufe0f",
            "A post shared by  Team USA (@teamusa) on Feb 3, 2020 at 9:33am PST",
            "\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be in school,\u201d Roberts says, \u201cbut they were on their phones during the day and took screenshots, sent it to me and asked, \u2018Did you see this?\u2019 The first three times I told them \u2018no,\u2019 but finally, I just responded, \u2018Do you want to ride tonight?\u2019\u201d",
            "For hours, Roberts and her young pupils film each other on their phones while they attempt high-flying tricks into a large yellow foam pit and eat slices of greasy pizza. She\u2019s proud of how they have improved under her tutelage. Their parents comment on how much she has inspired them. Roberts also expects this will be one of her last carefree runs before she transitions to a training regimen suitable for an Olympic athlete. She sits and soaks in nostalgia from her surroundings instead of sending her own tricks into the foam pit.",
            "\u201cThe last four years of me living here, I rode with every one of these kids almost every day,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cI\u2019d pick them up from their house if they needed a ride or I\u2019d take them to a skatepark. If I wanted to make a day trip to Ohio just to ride something different, they were always in my car going with me.\u201d",
            "According to her mother, Roberts is at her happiest when she\u2019s working with kids, though she still fits within a broad definition of \u201cadolescent\u201d herself.",
            "Roberts grew up in the 4,000-person town of Buchanan, Michigan, a few miles north of the Indiana state border and a 20-minute drive from South Bend. Decades ago, Buchanan\u2019s rolling terrain gave birth to RedBud MX, one of America\u2019s signature motocross tracks and now an annual stop for the Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship. In the fall of 2018, the track even hosted Motocross of Nations, which is billed as the \u201cOlympics of motocross,\u201d drawing riders from all over the world.",
            "The fact Buchanan produced a world-renowned extreme sports athlete like Roberts isn\u2019t a surprise. But Roberts is unique because her success never came on a dirt bike. If not for her father\u2019s disapproval, Roberts might have given motocross a real shot, but the closest she ever came was working a taco stand at RedBud MX during her summers.",
            "Her passion for BMX was passed on from her older cousin, Brett \u201cMad Dog\u201d Banasiewicz, once an up-and-comer on the Dew Tour. In 2012, as a shaggy black-haired 17-year-old, he won his first Dew Tour park event in Ocean City, Maryland. The following week, his professional career came to a devastating end. During a practice session, he landed on his head while attempting a 720\u00b0 and wearing an uncertified helmet. He temporarily lost the use of his left arm, and his motor and speech skills will never fully recover.",
            "\u201cIt was horrible. To me, he was gonna be the next Dave Mirra,\u201d says Daniel Dhers, one of the most decorated BMX riders of all-time. \u201cHe just learned how to compete. He had all these tricks that he\u2019d worked on for years. He had the looks, and he could talk, and was funny. If he were riding today? He\u2019d be the guy in the Olympics, for sure. That would be crazy because then it would be him and Hannah.\u201d",
            "Roberts herself has suffered numerous broken bones, but fear of suffering an injury like Banasiewicz doesn\u2019t hold her back.",
            "\u201cYou can take all the safety precautions in the world, but it still could happen,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cBrett fell on a trick that he\u2019d mastered, that he\u2019d been doing forever. It was five seconds and everything changed.\u201d",
            "Before the injury, a 16-year-old Banasiewicz self-funded and, with the help of his friend Glenn Salyers, designed The Kitchen. They equipped it with enormous ramps, foam pits, and \u201cresi\u201d ramps, which are covered in foam and a thick sheet of black rubber. By the time she was riding at nine years old, Roberts had access to one of the nation\u2019s premier skateparks.",
            "Swiss-American freestyle rider Nikita Ducarroz, five years Roberts\u2019 senior and a likely qualifier for the 2020 Olympics for Switzerland, remembers trekking to The Kitchen from her Southern California home for a competition as a teenager. She almost froze at the magnitude of its jumps.",
            "\u201cThe ramps at The Kitchen are huge,\u201d Ducarroz says. \u201cI remember going there, and I couldn\u2019t even cruise the boxes and [Hannah\u2019s] doing tricks over them.\u201d",
            "By middle school, Roberts was already performing tricks that seasoned veterans with sponsorships had never seen.",
            "\u201cShe was the first girl I saw do a tailwhip,\u201d Buitrago says. \u201cOnce she has a trick, she can just do it. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s luck.\u201d",
            "But as much as The Kitchen spurred Roberts\u2019 BMX education, she eventually realized she had to leave it behind.",
            "For years, Roberts believed members of her inner circle credited The Kitchen for too much of her success, disregarding her work ethic and determination. And she could only spend so much time mentoring other young BMXers without sacrificing her own progress.",
            "\u201cI love riding with the locals,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cI love helping them, but it comes to a point where, in every session, if you\u2019re focusing on other people riding, which I love to do, your riding starts to fall.\u201d",
            "Roberts gave up her passion for mentoring, at least temporarily, to better her career. She had felt the pain of losing the 2018 World Championships and the rainbow jersey. She never wants to let that happen again.",
            "Holly Springs \u2014 a pine tree- and strip mall-filled landscape similar to every other suburb in the Raleigh, N.C., metropolitan area \u2014 has quickly become the new mecca of freestyle BMX. That\u2019s largely thanks to Dhers, who owns the massive indoor-outdoor skatepark known as the Daniel Dhers Action Sports Complex. Dhers, 35, is a five-time X Games gold medalist originally from Venezuela.",
            "From the front, the DDASC looks like an office building or outlet store, industrial gray brick and dark windows covering the outside. The inside doesn\u2019t look like what a typical sports fan might expect from an Olympic training facility. Plywood and two-by-fours are the predominant decor. But the 37,000-square-foot complex is considered one of the largest and best family-oriented, year-round skating and biking facilities in the world.",
            "After spending her entire life in the Midwest, Roberts moved to Holly Springs to train at the DDASC because, unlike most other Olympic athletes, the best BMX riders like to train side-by-side, pushing each other.",
            "The park officially opens to the public every weekday from 3 to 8 p.m. Dhers and the other pros do most of their riding in the morning to avoid crowds of young kids on scooters, but they often make exceptions on Tuesday evenings.",
            "Recently, Roberts was joined by two other women riders: Ducarroz and Benegas, the winner of the 2018 World Championships. Roberts and Benegas are teammates and rivals. Their tug-of-war relationship only intensified after both became near-locks to qualify for the Olympics.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very competitive now,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cWe call it winning practice, which makes no sense because it\u2019s practice, but everybody wants to win.\u201d",
            "The male riders include Dhers, Marin Rante\u0161 of Croatia, American Justin Dowell and Australian Brand Loupos. All have finished on the podium at major UCI and FISE BMX events over the last two years.",
            "During training sessions at the DDASC, each rider takes turns dropping in from the deck and riding for 30 to 40 seconds at a time, watching each other and offering criticism and encouragement. On one run, Roberts lands a tailwhip onto resi with relative ease. She then rides around the skatepark to pick up speed and hits the same ramp, performing a 360\u00b0 tuck no-hander in which, while letting go of the bike, she leans her stomach against the handlebars before grabbing them again and landing.",
            "Much of her competition would be thrilled with this short run, but Roberts is just getting started.",
            "\u201cBackflip bar spins over spines is her warm-up trick in sessions,\u201d Ducarroz says.",
            "Unfortunately, the sport of freestyle BMX hasn\u2019t progressed as quickly as its athletes.",
            "Freestyle BMX has been around since the mid-1970s, but didn\u2019t achieve international prominence until the late 90s and early 2000s, after the X Games were started. Yet, to this day, women BMXers aren\u2019t allowed to vie for a medal in the competition.",
            "Instead, the most that X Games organizers have been willing to give them is an unpaid demonstration, the first of which occurred in 2014. For 10 years before that, X Games offered a girls BMX clinic. The riders hope that, one day, women\u2019s freestyle BMX will have its own competition, similar to what women\u2019s skateboarding and snowboarding have enjoyed for years.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this relationship with X Games for so long,\u201d Buitrago says. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re so close, but they just were like, \u2018Well, we\u2019re just going to offer you another demo again.\u2019 The deal that we made was [that] women are down to do the demo, so long as every year we\u2019re working towards having an actual contest.\u201d",
            "But everyone has their limits. In 2018, when she was16, Roberts became the first prominent female rider to bail on the X Games, deciding her skills were worth more than a free hotel room and limited exposure. Some of the other professional riders protested her decision, saying it wasn\u2019t best for the sport, but her mind was made up.",
            "The following year, the entire women\u2019s class agreed to boycott the event.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a big risk, especially the year before the Olympics, to ride at an event where you won\u2019t make money,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cWe barely get a crowd. They have it at like 9 or 10 a.m., so nobody\u2019s really there. No events are going on. It\u2019s just a big slap in the face.",
            "\u201cPeople should really open their eyes and realize that the class [of women] is growing. That people are getting better and it will take time for us to be on the same level as the men just because of the support. It\u2019s hard to make [BMX] a career.\u201d",
            "Roberts learned from a young age that practice, more than exposure, would propel her career.",
            "At the DDASC, Dhers is the unofficial coach of the group. He periodically pulls riders aside for extra one-on-one attention while they train. When Roberts first moved to Holly Springs, her day-to-day riding was inconsistent. One day, she might push herself beyond her limits, risking injury and wearing herself out. The next, she\u2019d spend too much time on her phone or drinking an energy drink. Dhers and the other pros helped her change her mentality by pushing her to take a more mindful, calculated approach to practicing new tricks.",
            "Now she\u2019s deliberate about how much time she spends sending a trick to the foam pit, only moving to resi once she feels she\u2019s ready, then moving to a wooden ramp when the trick is nearly perfect.",
            "\u201cI used to just send things [on a wooden ramp] and then go back on resi and then go back in the foam and work on them, which was a terrible idea,\u201d Roberts says.",
            "Her new mentality has paid real dividends. For instance, on a six-week training trip she took to Australia after her victory at the World Championships, Roberts learned more than two dozen new tricks, including what she called five or six \u201cbig tricks.\u201d During that time, she traveled throughout the country, staying with Australian rider Natalya Diehm.",
            "Roberts knew she had to evolve. She noticed other women catching up to her, and the number of competitors increasing exponentially. She\u2019s stubborn according to those who know her well. She got to the top of her profession as a teenager, after all, even before she got to Holly Springs.",
            "According to Dhers, Roberts\u2019 persistent \u2018send-it mentality\u2019 came from her Kitchen days, riding massive ramps with no one to tell her she shouldn\u2019t. On ramps that size, riders must possess a certain degree of fearlessness to commit to a trick. It was there she learned a fundamental lesson of the sport.",
            "\u201cIf you baby it, you die,\u201d Dhers says. \u201cYou don\u2019t make it.\u201d",
            "The Covid-19 pandemic first hit the freestyle BMX world Feb. 22 when FISE and the UCI canceled the World Cup event scheduled for May in Pu Yang, China. A few weeks later, a second World Cup event in Hiroshima was postponed indefinitely. After a period of insisting the games would be held as scheduled, the International Olympic Committee finally announced on March 24 the postponement of the Tokyo Games until 2021.",
            "In the days following the news, Roberts spent more time in her bedroom than at the DDASC, moving back and forth from her bed, to playing video games, to her desk to email Team USA and other sponsors.",
            "Focusing on a few companies at a time, she figured out which of her sponsorships were most impacted. The Milk Processor Education Program, the group behind the \u201cGot Milk?\u201d campaign, adjusted their contract with Roberts, but her contracted sponsorships within the BMX industry \u2014 Tioga, Alienation, Hyper Bike and Snafu \u2014 were still intact.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s still just a little frustrating going through all the emails and making sure that we\u2019re all on the same page and we all know what\u2019s happening, who\u2019s getting paid when and what is expected of me,\u201d Roberts says.",
            "Perhaps the biggest frustration was the notion that all the hard work she\u2019d been putting in towards the Olympics \u2014 the stringent riding schedule, changes to her diet, dedication to the gym \u2014 wouldn\u2019t pay off like she had planned.",
            "\u201cI was happy that the committee put in the consideration for athletes\u2019 health,\u201d Roberts says, \u201cbut it\u2019s also disappointing and nerve-wracking because you have to keep the Olympic mindset for the next year and deal with all the same stuff over again.\u201d",
            "Thankfully, Roberts will not have to requalify. She will represent Team USA at the Olympics in 2021. And she\u2019s still training.",
            "Because of the pandemic, skateparks all across the country are closed to the public, including the DDASC. But all the pros agreed that if they only saw each other, and had all groceries and food delivered, that they could continue to practice together. Dhers turned the upper deck of the skatepark into a mini gym, equipped with dumbbells, a pull-up bar and two plastic trash cans attached at opposite ends of a workout bar.",
            "Roberts still rides for three to four hours a day with the group, but she works out at home in the afternoons using exercise bands. She also tries to get up at 6 a.m. every morning for cardio and stretching. The UCI rainbow jersey hanging in her bedroom closet helps keep her focused.",
            "\u201cWhen I don\u2019t feel like riding in the morning or when I don\u2019t feel like getting up and going to the session or the workout, I look at it and it gives me that extra motivation,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to lose this again.\u2019\u201d",
            "This should have been the year when Roberts\u2019 profile skyrocketed. Through no fault of her own, 2020 feels like a step back, a disheartening tumble after a redemptive 2019. Still, it\u2019s difficult to know how much an Olympic gold medal would elevate her career.",
            "\u201cCNN could pick it up and then boom, she\u2019s a famous superstar, or no one could pick it up and then nothing ever happens,\u201d Dhers says. \u201cHow many Olympic gold medalists are there for the women in other sports and no one knows they exist?\u201d",
            "Roberts doesn\u2019t seem to be banking on superstardom, at least. For now, she\u2019s being frugal, saving almost every dime from her contest winnings.",
            "Certainly, the more visible Roberts is, the more popular she and the sport can become. For years, Roberts has been considered a leader in freestyle BMX because of her strong example. That \u2018send-it mentality,\u2019 again.",
            "\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that when you see a woman do something, you\u2019re like, \u2018oh, my gosh, it\u2019s possible,\u2019\u201d Buitrago says. \u201cFor whatever reason, you see guys do the same trick but when you see a woman do [a trick] that you haven\u2019t ever seen them do before, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, my God. Yes.\u2019\u201d",
            "But Roberts doesn\u2019t focus much on the stakes, only on how she\u2019s pushing herself at any point in time. Others may see unlimited potential, and an opportunity for fame and possibly fortune, but her goals are intrinsic.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily want to be the best woman BMX rider,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cI would rather just be a good or great BMX rider, in general, rather than having the woman or the man label on it.",
            "\u201cI just do whatever I think is possible and if it works out, it works out. And if not, try it again.\u201d"

            "Originating in the early 1970s, BMX was started it\u2019s meteoric rise after it was discovered that kids were taking to dirt tracks to mimic motocross races on their bicycles, complete with a number fastened to the front of the bike. As expected, the racing got more competitive, the demands on equipment became higher and more specialised, and subcultures naturally formed around street and freestyle BMX.",
            "Fast forward to today and BMX has come entirely of its own, with BMX racing being UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale, the governing body of cycling), sanctioned and featured in the Olympic Games. Freestyle BMX has professional riders and teams supported by massive sponsors competing at adrenalin-fueled events such as the X-games.",
            "Feeling spoilt for choice with what BMX to buy? We are here to clear things up, spell out the differences and arm you with the knowledge to confidently purchase the right BMX bike to suit your needs.",

            "Freestyle BMX bikes are designed to withstand the stresses that come with performing stunts on street features, dirt jumps, and skate parks. This means that the frame materials, wheels, and components must be equally optimised for both strength and ease of maneuverability. Race BMX bikes are optimised for speed and acceleration, so are often made from lighter materials and feature different geometry to ensure they are stable, stiff and agile at speed.",
            "Within freestyle BMX several sub-disciplines fall under the umbrella of the term 'freestyle'. Except for flatland, there is a lot of crossover within these disciplines, so choosing an all-rounder bike that is categorised as freestyle will likely be the most versatile option.",
            "Park: Park riding refers to riding in skate parks, which despite the name, are frequented by BMX riders almost as often as skaters. Park riding also extends to BMX specific indoor parks for riders only, which are commonly referred to as 'ramps'.",
            "Street: As the name would suggest, street riders get creative with urban infrastructure such as stairs and rails to perform highly skilled tricks and turns. Riders will always be on the lookout for right 'spots' to try new skills.",
            "Flatland:  Quite a niche style, flatland occurs with no external features and all the tricks are done with the bike by the rider. Often described as 'breakdancing' on the bike, riders pivot and balance the bike with on a hard flat surface.",
            "Trails/Dirt Jumping:  Occurs on purpose build dirt jumps and berms. These riders look at getting big air and linking up jumps in to perform tricks.",
            "Race:  BMX stands for 'Bicycle Motocross' so it should come as little surprise that BMX bikes themselves are best known for being piloted over jumps and ripping around berms, much like their petrol-powered cousins. BMX racing occurs on purpose built courses which are made from hard-packed, well-groomed dirt or bitumen and often feature a mixture of undulating terrain and long jumps. Because BMX race bikes are designed with a sole purpose in mind, they are often unsuitable for use in other BMX riding disciplines.",
            "",
            "",
            "Freestyle and entry-level race BMX bikes are predominately made from a steel composition known as Chromoly 4130 (chromo for short). CroMo is alloyed steel which offers superior strength properties when compared to cheaper, 'Hi-tensile' steels typically found on lower-end and department store bikes. Chromo steel can be 'butted', meaning it can be made to be thinner and therefore lighter in the middle of the tubing, and reinforced around the ends and joins for strength.",
            "Steel is the material of choice for these bikes as it is highly resistant to fatigue (important considering all the hits these bikes take!), is easy to repair and offers some additional compliance to the ride which adds a little more comfort and reduces pressure on the body of the rider.",
            "For BMX racing, the preference is for stiffer, lightweight frames meaning aluminium is the material of choice.  If you are serious about your racing and want to get the extra edge, carbon fibre frames are growing in popularity amongst elite BMX racers as it reduces weight even further and has vibration dampening properties not found in aluminium.",
            "For more information on bike frame materials, check out our comprehensive guide.",
            "",
            "",
            "Freestyle BMX bikes are ridden by kids, teenagers and adults alike; therefore, although the wheel size stays consistent, the frame size can change subtly to suit the riding style and height of the rider. Most freestyle BMX bikes off the shop floor will come with a 21in top tube so that riders have enough room to swing the bike underneath them if performing airborne tricks, as well as a shorter seat stay which is easier to whip around.",
            "Flatland frames are typically the only exception to this as they tend to be lighter and have shorter tubing all round for better balance and control. They also have a much steeper head angle and 3/8\" dropouts for smaller rear axles.",
            "On race bikes,  slacker head angle and longer wheelbase put the rider further back on the bike, which allows for improved stability and handling at speed. Race frame sizes come in a broader range to suit the rider age spread that BMX racing sees.",
            "",
            "",
            "The 'standard' size for a BMX wheel is 20in, which is much smaller than a mountain bike or road bike. Even smaller 16in or 18in wheels can be found on kids bikes, and a larger 22in or 24in wheel can be seen on some 'trail' BMX bikes used for dirt jumping.  However, it is safe to assume that 'BMX' will generally refer to a bike with 20in wheels.",
            "Racing BMX bikes fall into two categories, depending on wheel size. The first is 20in - the most common, the second is 24in or 'cruiser'. Cruiser bikes are popular amongst taller or older riders, and also offer more stability.",
            "Because racing BMX demands lightening-quick acceleration out of starting gates, the wheels are lighter than in freestyle BMX.",
            "",
            "",
            "The standard rim width is 32mm for freestyle bikes. For those riders who expect they will put a few more hard-hits into the wheels, can opt for a wider 36mm rim. Rims are made of aluminium and can be single, double or triple walled, the more layers of metal provide more structural support, albeit at the penalty of increased weight. The ideal standard for a majority of riders is double-wall as it is a good balance of strength and weight.",
            "Advanced riders who put more demand on their equipment will generally choose to have wheels built up aftermarket to suit their requirements precisely and be more selective with rims and spoke count.",
            "",
            "",
            "Spoke count is another thing to consider when choosing a BMX or buying some new wheels. Spokes are 'laced' from the hub to the rim and rely on tension to stay true and strong. The number of spokes contributes to the strength ( as well as the weight) of the complete wheel.  A 36 spoke wheel will suffice for most riders on a freestyle BMX bike. More advanced riders or heavier riders may opt for up a 48 spoke wheel. Most spokes are made from steel wire and are the same thickness all the way through, but if you see something referring to 'butted' spokes, like butted frames, this means that the spokes are thinner in the middle and thicker at the end for added strength but reduced weight.",
            "Race BMX wheels will be anywhere between a 28 to 36 spoke build and have alloy rims engineered to shave weight where possible.",
            "",
            "",
            "Being the first point of contact to the riding surface, tyre choice will affect the speed (rolling resistance), grip and handling of the bike. For street and park riding, smooth rolling, wider tyres are preferable. Premium BMX tyres can accept pressures up to 110psi, which will roll faster than a lower inflated tyre and offer rim protection when under load after hard landings.",
            "Dirt jumpers will opt for something with more tread for traction on the dirt and run their tyres at lower pressure for better grip. Wider than a race tyre, look for 20in x 2.1 for better stability and more surface area. The good thing is, tyres are easily swapped and changed, so you can choose to change them if you feel the need.",
            "Tyres for racing are usually narrower in suit the slimmer rim profile and reduce weight, as well as roll faster on the racetrack.",
            "The centrepiece of a wheel, BMX hubs house the bearings on which the wheels spin and are typically made from alloy. Bikes or wheelsets at lower price points will feature open-cage ball bearings, which, while cost-effective, are susceptible to more damage and are less durable than the alternative, a sealed or cartridge bearing. Cartridge bearings have the small steel balls kept within a sealed unit, and as such are protected from becoming contaminated by dirt and debris. Choosing a BMX bike or wheelset that features sealed bearings will mean a smoother and more reliable ride. The standard BMX axle size is 14mm,  with flatland BMX bikes opting for 3/8\" (10mm) axles for weight savings. The axle fits through the centre of the hub and then slides into the dropouts in the frame to keep the wheel in place,  fastened with bolts. BMX bikes do not use quick-release systems.",
            "BMX hubs come in four different types;",
            "Cassette: Essentially the same mechanism as a mountain or road bike, the cassette hub uses an independent driver fitted onto the hub shell. Weighing less and generally easier to install and service, cassette hubs are the most popular choice for BMX bikes in both race and freestyle disciplines.",
            "Freecoaster: Freecoaster hubs divide opinions in the BMX world, and are often only selected to help with specific tricks and are usually only used by flatland riders. The point of difference is that freecoaster hubs have an internal clutch system that allows the rider to coast backward, so the wheel will actually drive backward without the cranks turning. Freecoasters are distinctly quiet when pedalling but will elicit a 'clicking' sound when coasting. Because of their more intricate design requiring more parts, these hubs are typically more expensive and weigh a bit more than a standard cassette hub.",
            "Freewheel: These types of hubs used to be the standard, but have mostly been phased out in favour of cassette hubs. Freewheel hubs have the sprocket (sometimes referred to as the 'driver') threaded directly onto the hub shell. The smallest gearing available for a freewheel is 13-tooth, which is limits gearing options for freestyle riders (more about gear ratios and sprockets below).",
            "Coaster: Coaster hubs are also known as 'back pedal brakes' whereby the ride will engage the brake when they pedal backward. Coaster hubs will rarely be seen on a freestyle BMX bike, except for kids and entry-level bikes.",
            "",
            "",
            "You may hear the words sprocket and chainring interchanged, but to keep it clear here we will refer to the chainring as the front ring attached to the cranks, and the sprocket as the rear driver attached to the hub.",
            "Although BMX bikes don't have multiple gears, the thing to consider is the number of teeth on the chainring and sprocket and the ideal pairing of these, also known as the 'gear ratio'. \nTo determine the gear ratio, you will need some basic mathematics. Simply divide the number of teeth on the chainring (say, 25) by the number on the sprocket (nine), and you will be left with 2.78 meaning the rear wheel will rollover approximately two-and-three-quarter times for every rotation of the chainring.  The lower the number, the easier to pedal, the higher, the harder it is to pedal (requires more force).",
            "In order to ride out of tricks and better clearance over features, the trend for freestyle BMX is to have a smaller chainring/sprocket combination than traditional or race BMX's.  A typical gear ratio is 25/9 (referring to the chainring/sprocket respectively). This means it takes little effort for the rider to accelerate quickly into a trick or a jump, but means they are compromised on top and speed and power.",
            "BMX race bikes need to allow the rider to generate explosive power, so a much larger chainring is used. Gearing choice on a BMX race bike gets quite in depth the more progressive the riding becomes, and because there are discrepancies between wheel sizes and tyre widths, it goes beyond merely gear ratio.",
            "BMX racers will be choosing and changing gear ratios to match the rhythm and demand of different race tracks, or simply to suit their physiology or ability level. When looking to purchase, it is safe to trust the gearing for race bikes will be approximately 55 gear inches, which is likely to suit the majority of riders.",
            "",
            "",
            "BMX cranks come in one-piece, two-piece or three-piece units.",
            "One-piece cranks have the left and right crankarms and spindle all as one piece of steel. The arms thinner and are much more flimsy, only seen nowadays on kids bikes for very cheap BMX bikes.\nFor two-piece configurations, the spindle is fixed to only one crank arm, and the other is separate. These tend to be thicker and sturdier than the latter. Three-piece cranks are much stronger and have both crank arms and the spindle as three different units. Ideally, choose a BMX with a two or three-piece Chromoly crank for strength and durability.",
            "Crank lengths can vary from 145mm up to 190mm - however most freestyle riders will opt for shorter cranks to allow for clearance when performing tricks, a common choice is 165mm. Race BMX crank size is dependent on rider height, and will sometimes be made of aluminium to reduce weight.",
            "The pedal of choice for all types of freestyle BMX is a wide platformed plastic pedal to reduce weight and are generally inexpensive. An added bonus is plastic is slightly less harsh than metal pedals should an (inevitable) blow to the shins occur.  The pedal axle will be 9/16in on two three-piece cranks and 1/2in on one-piece cranks. It is essential to know what size you have buying new pedals!",
            "The preference for racing is to use SPD, or clip-in pedals. These pedals provide the rider with the ability to generate maximum power for and get up to speed as the gate drops.",
            "Of course, if you are new to BMX, a flat pedal will suffice while building confidence in handling and gate starts.",
            "Saddles do not play much of an essential role in the setup of BMX bikes, so the preference for saddles is for minimalism, even so far as to have completely plastic saddles. Entry level BMX bikes will have a bit more cushion and larger surface area as again the assumption is that the rider will be sitting down and pedalling more than an advanced rider who will be floating above the saddle a lot.",
            "Rails: Just like a mountain or road bike, the has rails on either side that sit in a clamp attached to the seat post.",
            "Pivotal saddles: The saddle is connected to the seatpost via a single bolt that goes through the middle of the seat and into the seatpost.",
            "Integrated seat/seatpost: Some manufacturers produce a complete unit that is the seat and seatpost integrated into one. Not ideal for sitting on, but reduces weight significantly.",
            "",
            "",
            "Freestyle handlebars rise steeper than race BMX bars to be maneuvered better. Usually made from Chromoly or aluminium, the latter being lighter but more susceptible to fatigue, and steel will be heavier but dampen vibrations better and last longer.",
            "Bars found on 24-inch BMX bikes might not have a crossbar and have significantly less rise to account for the higher stack due to the larger frame and bigger wheels.",
            "Flatland handlebars usually have a very minimal sweep, so the bars feel basically the same when pointed forward or backward, as well as a low crossbar so riders can swing their leg over for tricks.",
            "BMX bikes will typically feature rim-brakes, where the pads connect to the rim to slow momentum. Freestyle bikes are equipped U-brake that sits inside the rear triangle and out of the way of the rider. Many freestyle bikes may also come with a 'detangler' or 'Gyro' braking system for the rear brake.",
            "Distinguishable by the division of two cables around a mechanism fitted at the headtube,  the detangler allows the bars to spin a full 360 degrees without the brake cable getting tangled. This is incredibly helpful for advancing tricks such as barspins and tailwhips.  If these sorts of tricks are not going to be on your radar, a standard brake will suffice.",
            "Although a front brake is allowed in racing, it is not necessary with most racers opting for a secure, linear-pull rear brake only, also called V-brake.",
            "",
            "",
            "Helmets for freestyle BMX cover a large proportion of the head and take a more 'bowl' shaped look than the low profile, highly-vented road cycling helmets. These helmets will have minimal vents and can extend to covering the ears as well. This is to take into account that BMX riders may take a stack while attempting a trick and are at risk of landing in any direction. When racing BMX, there are rules and restrictions around equipment on the racetrack. In training and competition, a full-faced helmet must be worn along with long pants and long-sleeved jersey.",
            "Gloves: Regardless of whether you're riding freestyle, or racing your BMX bikes, full fingered gloves are a must. BMX specific gloves will typically feature grip on the palm of the glove that extends to the tips of the fingers.",
            "Shoes:  If you are riding with clip-in pedals, look for some mountain bike or BMX specific clip in shoes that offer a good amount of stiffness and comfort.",
            "Pegs: Pegs are metal cylinders (or sometimes solid plastic) that are fitted to the axles of the BMX bike so the rider can balance on them for tricks in flatland, or perform grinds on rails or ledges in street and park riding. Flatland will usually have pegs on all 4 axles, whereas street riders will have just one side with pegs on the front and rear. Pegs are strictly banned in BMX racing.",
            "Buying a BMX for anyone under the age of 12 is an excellent way to get them on the bike in a fuss-free fashion. No gears and a sturdy frame mean kids can experiment and find their comfort zone with riding a bike along with tackling a range of terrain including footpaths hard packed dirt trails.",
            "Kids BMX bikes are available as scaled-down versions of adult 20in bikes, with some brands offering Chromoly steel 16in and 18in freestyle bikes. Race BMX bikes are available as 'mini-micro' and 'micro' for kids getting into racing.",
            "More traditionally, at the lower price point, a high-tensile steel frame will come equipped with a coaster brake, one-piece cranks,  training wheels and accessories such as chain guards, a basket or frame pads.  These are suited to younger kids just getting on their first bike but are not designed to take the hits that a freestyle BMX will. If a child is showing interest in finding new limits and trying new things, it might be time to update the equipment to match the skill.",

            "Buying online: Buying online from a manufacturer cuts out the middleman, reducing the overall cost which is then passed on to the consumer. This can be a great way to save money but should be approached with caution. Buying online has its pitfalls; you generally * can't* inspect the bike, take it for a test ride, check if it fits, assess unique features, make alterations or ask questions. It's a dangerous game unless you know your exact size and specifications.",
            "Buying Used: Many BMX race clubs, or online forums will either have a relationship with a BMX dealer or will list bikes for sale within the club, either new or used. Additionally, the BMX club can help advise what to look for when you are first starting out with racing. Of course, always be somewhat cautious when buying a used bike as you don't want to find out later you have been short-changed.",

            "We all love dirt bikes around here; there\u2019s no question about that. But, there\u2019s something we love even more \u2013 unbelievable dirt bike tricks. We simply can\u2019t get enough of them. We would sit and watch dirt bike stunts all day if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that we have other things to do.",
            "And sometimes we don\u2019t.",
            "While it\u2019s a lot of fun to do tricks on any bike, there\u2019s something special and unique about getting your dirt bike up in the air. When you get on the back of your dirt bike, you are already in for an adventure. Between the trails, dirt mounds and water forging, there\u2019s no limit to the places you can explore.",
            "With that said, it\u2019s time to look at some of the coolest tricks you can do on your dirt bike. We want to tell you not to try them at home because it\u2019s the right thing to say. Chances are, you are not going to listen to our warning anyway, but it\u2019s been said.",
            "Without further ado, these are 8 of the craziest stunts of all time and professional advice on how to do them. Tell us your favorites in the comments!",
            "Source",
            "We have to wonder who the first person was to attempt this crazy stunt. Most people credit Adam Jones with the creation. He performed the feat during the X-Games 13 Moto Best Trick in 2007. What we want to know is how much time did this guy have on his hands to create such an intricate stunt?",
            "Also, how many times did the guy screw this up before getting it right? It doesn\u2019t seem like something you just go out and do. It looks extremely dangerous and definitely not something we feel equipped to try\u2026yet.",
            "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the stunt with the help of Levi Sherwood. In this video from Red Bull Moments, he breaks down the action well.",
            "You clearly start by doing a backflip with your bike. That\u2019s nothing new, I do that all the time. Sure.",
            "Then, as you are mid-air, you have to extend your feet and legs under your arms and through the handlebars. What could possibly go wrong? He talks about what could happen including not getting enough air off the ramp, getting your feet stuck between the handlebars or ending up upside down on the ground. Short answer: death.",
            "Either way, no one can deny that this dirt bike stunt is awesome, hard, and not for the faint of heart.",
            "If you can do a front flip, you\u2019ve got something special going. There aren\u2019t nearly as many riders that can perform a double front flip, which makes that single flip look pretty wimpy. Watching this dirt bike stunt is far easier than actually attempting to do it.",
            "Source",
            "Back in 2014, one brave FMX rider set out to complete this trick. Bruce Cook gave it a go. No one can deny that it was one of the biggest nights in motorsports. When Cook attempted the stunt and fell, the world was shocked. The entire crowd got quiet as help rushed to him. Turns out, he was paralyzed from the waist down after that attempt.",
            "It took another two years before someone wanted to give it a go. Greg Duffy showed off his skills at Travis Pastrana\u2019s house and it looked like he would have no trouble nailing it. He moves forward with the next logical step; to try it out during an FMX competition.",
            "If you haven\u2019t seen the video outlining the events, make sure you watch that now. With practicing not going in Greg\u2019s favor, some people weren\u2019t sure he would actually get up the nerve to attempt the stunt during the competition. Shockingly, he landed it and took home the title of FMX Best Trick Winner.",
            "Sure this looks like it couldn\u2019t possibly be that difficult, but you need to think about the physics for a minute. You have to push yourself to go against the bike in this situation. That\u2019s what makes a front flip so much harder than a backflip. It\u2019s a different body movement altogether.",
            "Even still, when it finally gets landed, there\u2019s also no doubt that it is one of the coolest dirt bike tricks around. Still, we aren\u2019t quite sure we would ever have the balls to attempt it.",
            "The next logical step from here is to look at the double backflip. While it might have been done more often than the double front flip, don\u2019t think for a second that it is easy.",
            "We have a deep appreciation for anyone that can pull off this unbelievable dirt bike trick.",
            "Source",
            "It\u2019s hard enough getting the bike to go around backward once, let alone twice. To do it, you will need to get some massive air time. The less air you achieve, the less time there is to complete the rotations. If you don\u2019t get through the rotation, you aren\u2019t going to land on your tires.",
            "The first person we know who landed the double backflip during a competition was Travis Pastrana. Back in 2006, he performed this stunt during the X Games 12 in Los Angeles.",
            "Take a look at the video for yourself. What\u2019s most shocking is that he struggles with over-rotation, so to compensate, he wants to go short. What you see in the video is that he slaughtered this trick. They don\u2019t come much more perfect than that.",
            "Pretty much everything that Pastrana attempts to do comes across as seamless and perfect. He gives us the hope that even the regular riders could accomplish such a feat \u2013 although, we will probably never be quite that cool.",
            "This trick is a mouthful to say, but awesome to watch. It relies on the ability to maintain control over the dirt bike and perform plenty of intricate footwork in midair. Even after you pull all of that off, then you have to land it, which is a feat in itself.",
            "Source",
            "In our video, Jimmy Fitzpatrick, the Metal Mulisha rider, offers all the steps needed to perform this crazy stunt. We know just watching it gets our blood moving, and we can\u2019t even imagine what it feels like to actually accomplish it.",
            "As he explains in the video, you need to get a good amount of air, a straight pull on the bike and make sure you crank up your steering stabilizer for stiffer handling. Once you know the lift is good, then you can make the transfer to the grab. He also discusses missing the handlebars when you try to come back. Not ideal.",
            "If this is a stunt you would want to try, make sure you check out the video.",
            "Just keep in mind that this trick has probably been attempted by thousands who didn\u2019t land it. It actually causes us to wince for a second thinking about all the falls that likely occurred from riders trying to get it right. Still, it\u2019s plenty of fun to watch and dream.",
            "Backflips are a necessary staple with dirt bike stunts. They are popular and tend to draw huge crowds. What we really like are the flips that add something a little extra. It helps to set the rider apart from the numerous others that can turn their bike over in the air, and a midair upside-down plank is spot on.",
            "Source",
            "If there is anyone that has mastered this skill, it has to be Taka Higashino. We\u2019ve included a video of him perfecting it during Dew Tour San Francisco 2012. What makes this trick absolutely captivating is the fact that for a second, there are no hands on the bike at all.",
            "So, while he is in the air, in the middle of doing the backflip, his body comes off the bike and then he takes his hands off as well. We aren\u2019t sure how he can possibly end up back on the bike, but he does. Honestly, at what point does a rider decide that doing a backflip with a seat grab simply isn\u2019t hard enough? What makes them try to go even harder?",
            "Balls. Massive balls.",
            "We don\u2019t understand the balls these guys have but we are thankful for the entertainment they provide. They sure do know how to showcase some unbelievable dirt bike tricks.",
            "What could possibly make a backflip even more interesting? How about the Kiss of Death?",
            "These names are entertaining enough, but then the stunts are crazy too. There\u2019s no doubt that your heart will not remain calm while watching this dirt bike trick.",
            "Source",
            "Part of this stunt involves the rider\u2019s face coming super close to the tire. Maybe that\u2019s what they are trying to kiss and why this move is named as such.",
            "To best illustrate the stunt, let\u2019s take a look at Levi Sherwood during the London Red Bull X-Fighters 2010. This video is in slow motion which helps you to fully appreciate the moves he performs.",
            "What we find most impressive is the way he bends his back. Many of us aren\u2019t capable of moving in those ways on the living room floor, let alone while trying to do a stunt. Simply amazing if you ask us.",
            "Everyone knows that Josh Sheehan is an amazing rider. There\u2019s no question about it; the guy has mad skills. In 2015, he made history when he landed the first-ever triple backflip on a dirt bike.",
            "Source",
            "Most people just assume that if anyone were to be the first to land the triple backflip it would be Pastrana. You would be wrong! Yes, he was the pioneer in the double backflip back in 2006, but he doesn\u2019t get to hold this record.",
            "Still, he did attempt it at a top secret facility in Long Beach, California back in 2011. While the monstrous jump that was created made for lots of amazing double backflips, he couldn\u2019t get it around the third time. Still, he knew it was possible and knew it would happen in time.",
            "That\u2019s where Sheehan comes in. At Pastranaland, we find him performing the very first triple backflip in history on a dirt bike. If you can watch this video without getting entirely pumped up, there\u2019s something wrong with you.",
            "Remember when we told you about Bruce Cook who became paralyzed while trying to do the double front flip? In 2015, he made history when he refused to be a victim to his circumstances.",
            "Many riders would have quit after the accident he had and would have hung their heads in pity, but not Bruce. Not him.",
            "Source",
            "While it might not seem like a big deal to many to see a dirt bike backflip, you can tell from the audience in this crowd that it is something special.",
            "Cook modified his dirt bike to make it work with his body. Then, he strapped himself in tight and did a flawless backflip. Just watch the video for yourself and prepare to be fresh out of excuses as to why you can\u2019t do it.",
            "We don\u2019t know anyone that\u2019s been able to watch this video without feeling a sense of inspiration. It truly makes you feel like anything is possible, with plenty of hard work. Our hats are off to Bruce Cook. This is truly the best dirt bike stunt we\u2019ve ever seen and it will be incredibly difficult to top.",
            "All beginner riders set out to tackle all of the biggest dirt bike tricks they can find. The trouble is, the dirt bike stunts on this list aren\u2019t ones you are going to get on your bike and learn immediately. Instead, you will need to learn the basics safely and slowly. It\u2019s why the pros have their own practice areas they spend hours and hours a day riding on.",
            "That\u2019s why you want to master some easy dirt bike tricks for beginners first.",
            "As you learn the easier skills, you will gain more confidence. You will find yourself showing off all the tricks you learn to anyone that will watch. As you master each one, you will want to push harder into the more advanced stunts.",
            "Source",
            "While we are sure you are a dirt bike master in the making, we still have to say this. Before you attempt to do any tricks, you must become an expert at riding your dirt bike normally. This gives you the necessary control required to keep balance when you start jumping.",
            "Always begin by trying to do some small jumps before anything else. Once you perfect this skill, you can move on. We have a few suggestions for you to try out once you get the jumps down.",
            "As you hit mid-air, try to take one foot off your bike. This is a basic skill you will need to move forward. Each time you jump, you can position your foot out a little more. Start slowly and don\u2019t rush the process. You want to make sure you land safely.",
            "Source",
            "Give it a try with your other foot as well. See which one is easier for you to master. Once you perfect taking one foot off the bike while in the air, you should be able to take them both off. This doesn\u2019t take much more skill and is quite fun to do.",
            "Eventually, you will be able to do some pretty impressive seat grabs.",
            "Once you\u2019ve gotten your feet off the bike, the next logical step is to remove your hands. You are going to start with the same process; use just one hand at first and keep it near your handlebars at all times. This gives you the safety you need to ensure you can grab the bar if you need to.",
            "Once you get it with the first hand, try with the other. Practice with both until you can do it equally as well with either one. If you start to get really good at it, you can raise your hands above your head or hold them out the sides. That\u2019s pretty impressive.",
            "After lots of practice, you might even be able to learn a backflip with no hands. That\u2019s a big leap forward. Day 2 at minimum.",
            "Just kidding. More like year 2.",
            "Your next assignment is to learn the Fender Kiss. This is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 your face coming close to the fender. Why would someone want to do this, you ask? Because your dirt bike always deserves your unending appreciation and love.",
            "Source",
            "Nah, that\u2019s not why. It\u2019s simply cool and a fun trick to learn. This requires lots of patience, practice and skill. Once you master it, however, you will feel pretty good about yourself.",
            "Basically, you want to bring your face to meet up with the front bike fender while in the air. You could bring the fender to your face, but that movement is more difficult. Just keep in mind while you are learning that any change in bike position leads to a different action while in the air. Your bike will not be where it started.",
            "Plan to fall a few times before you master this stunt.",
            "To do it safely, consider just moving your face slightly towards the fender. Then, with each success, you can move a little closer. Eventually, you will kiss it.",
            "Here\u2019s a great example of what a superior Fender Kiss can look like. Just imagine you getting good enough to perform this dirt bike trick with ease.",
            "Once you\u2019ve been able to dominate the simple maneuvers, it is time for you to create some of your own unbelievable dirt bike tricks. Who knows, maybe you will be the next innovator like Travis Pastrana.",
            "If so, don\u2019t forget to give a shout out to your friends at Dirt Legal who offered you the advice that got you started!",
            "In all seriousness, it\u2019s vital that you build a solid foundation before you move onto anything hardcore. We know how exciting it can be to jump right in and push the boundaries, but it\u2019s not much fun when you end up with a broken bone or worse.

            "Rotorua just keeps getting cooler it seems. This latest addition sees riders throwing down double back flips and grabbing serious air with the launch of Freestyle Airbag \u2013 the newest experience at Velocity Valley.",

            "Managing director Simon Short said he was excited to launch New Zealand\u2019s first dedicated bike airbag that allowed riders to train for freestyle tricks as they descended a hill and hit one of three ramps (beginner, intermediate or advanced) to get air.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve got some really talented Kiwi riders around the country and Freestyle Airbag provides them the perfect tool for skills progression. It gives riders mental backup for attempting new tricks, with the perfect landing feedback, before they take the new skills to soil.\"",

            "Better still, you don't have to be a Crankworx star to drop in.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s great for a whole range of ages and skill levels from beginners (8yrs+) having a go at their first small jumps, right through to freeriders and international Crankworx slopestyle stars.\u201d\u00a0Local freestyle rider Connor Mahuika, widely known for his semi-final Crankworx placing in the Rotorua Pump Track Challenge presented by Rockshox, showed just what could be done at the launch.\u00a0\u201cI had always wanted to try a double back flip, but I\u2019d never had the chance till the Freestyle Airbag launched. After I got it dialled on the airbag, I tried it on a dirt jump and nailed it which was awesome!\"\u00a0\u201cI want to try and get into the Crankworx Mons Royale Dual Speed and Style for 2017, so now that I\u2019ve landed this double back flip, hopefully it will help.\u201d\u00a0Mahuika said a lot of his friends hadn't done back flips before, but they\u2019d been giving it a go on the new Freestyle Airbag.\u00a0Groups of younger kids, from eight years through to teens, had also been trying everything from beginner jumps, through to tricks and loving the experience, said Short.\u00a0Rotorua Lakes Council Deputy Mayor Dave Donaldson said there was a saying in slopestyle that it was all about progression.\u00a0\u201cWe would ideally love to have some Kiwis at slopestyle level, and thanks to Velocity Valley\u2019s vision we might one day get there with this excellent training tool.\u201d",

            "Freestyle motocross (also known as FMX) is a variation on the sport of motocross in which motorcycle riders attempt to impress judges with jumps and stunts.",
            "The two main types of freestyle events are:",
            "Notable freestyle motocross events include Red Bull X-Fighters, NIGHT of the JUMPs, the X Games, Gravity Games, Big-X, Moto-X Freestyle National Championship, and Dew Action Sports Tour.\nFreeriding is the original form of freestyle motocross which started in the hills of southern California; due to professional racers such as Jeremy McGrath and Phil Lawrence \"play riding\" in the hills of reche canyon. It has no structure, and is traditionally done on public land. Riders  form natural jumps and drop-offs to execute their tricks on. Some freeriders prefer to jump on sand dunes. In many ways, freeriding requires more skill and mental ability. Notable freeriding locations include Ocotillo Wells, Glamis Dunes and Beaumont in California, and Caineville, in Utah.",
            "The backflip was once considered all but impossible, the \"holy grail of FMX\". Freestyle riders began contemplating it after the 1998 film \"Children of a Metal God\" showed riders attempting the trick into water. Also it had been done many times on BMX bikes, and FMX riders were using tricks from BMX riders, such as when Travis Pastrana performed an Indian Air, originally from Mat Hoffman, a BMXer.[citation needed]",
            "In 1991, Jose Yanez became the first person to backflip a motocross bike.  He practiced for it by flipping his motorcycle into the Salt River, just as he had done with his BMX bike.  He would kill the engine on his 80cc motorcycle just before he hit the water to prevent damage to the bike. Yanez performed the world's first ramp-to-ramp motocross backflip on an 80cc motorcycle in October, 1991 on an 8' tall box jump he built himself in Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Jose's next motocross backflip attempt, this time for The National Enquirer, resulted in a crash that kept Jose off motorcycles and bicycles for two years due to an injured knee.",
            "In 1993, Bob Kohl was the second person to perform the backflip on a motocross bike. The bike was a 1993 Honda Cr80. He was a professional BMX rider who had performed the trick regularly on a bicycle. He continued to exhibit the trick until a crash in 1995 left him with serious injuries.",
            "In 2000, Carey Hart attempted the first backflip on a full-size motocross bike off a modified dirt landing ramp at the Gravity Games 2000. The landing was less than perfect, and Hart crashed immediately after. But Freestyle Motocross was forever changed. Many people started to attempt it, such as Travis Pastrana, who attempted the backflip off a Step Up jump at Summer X Games Freestyle. He bailed off mid-flight, breaking his foot. The trick was still not attempted on a normal FMX setup, off a ramp-to-dirt setup. Hart attempted the backflip again at Summer X Games in 2001, during the Moto X Best Trick competition, but bailed off the bike 45 feet (14\u00a0m) in the air, seriously injuring himself.",
            "In 2002, Caleb Wyatt was the first person to land a backflip on a large motorcycle, on April 25, 2002, at the Rogue Valley Motocross track (RVMX). This backflip was performed over a mulch pile of grass clippings, leaves, and bark collected during maintenance of the RVMX track. Wyatt constructed a quarter-pipe ramp with the take-off completely vertical shoved into the pile of mulch.",
            "2002 brought the backflip to X Games glory. Travis Pastrana and Mike Metzger were both capable doing flips off ramps. Kenny Bartram was still learning flips, doing them off the backsides of dirt landings, much like Hart in the 2000 Gravity Games. The unthinkable had become reality; a backflip was now common in freestyle competition. Mike Metzger had achieved a back-to-back backflip, which won him Freestyle Gold at Summer X Games 8. When the Gravity Games came along, riders were doing variations in their backflips, wowing the crowd and the judges, who didn't know how to score the riders.",
            "In 2003, regular tricks were being used in backflips such as 'No Footers', 'HeelClickers', and 'One Handed' Backflips.",
            "2003 - 2005: These years saw the development of variations including cliffhangers, cordovas etc. As well as the disputed 360s which some consider only off-axis flips. The backflip was perfected over large distances including over 100 feet (30\u00a0m). In 2005 at the very first Dew Tour in Louisville, Kentucky, Travis Pastrana landed four backflips in a row. At the Denver Dew Tour in 2006, Kenny Bartram was the first to pull a one-handed takeoff backflip. In 2009 while filming for \"Nitro Circus\", Pastrana completed a 120 feet (37\u00a0m) backflip as part of a larger crossover jump, flipping over a number of riders below in the process.",
            "2006 brought footage of Travis Pastrana completing a double backflip on an uphill/sand setup on his popular \"Nitro Circus\" Freestyle Motocross movies. On August 4, 2006, at X Games 12 in Los Angeles, he became the first rider to land a double backflip in competition. Having landed another trick that many had considered impossible, he vowed never to do it again.",
            "2007 saw Scott Murray perform double backflips onto a large piece of foam placed over the end of a foam pit. Later that year, Murray attempted the double backflip at X Games but crashed upon landing. He landed the trick at a Supercross event in Italy.",
            "At the 2008 Summer X games Jim Dechamp tried a front flip and crashed, breaking his back.  Three months later during Nitro Circus season 1 on MTV, Dechamp landed the front flip during the Guinness World Record episode.",
            "In early 2009, Metal Mulisha rider Jeremy Lusk attempted a Hart Attack Indian Air Backflip. He under-rotated, and crashed, hitting his head on the landing. On February 10, he was pronounced dead due to head and spinal cord injuries.",
            "At X Games 17, Jackson Strong nailed the first front flip on a dirt bike during the best trick competition.",
            "In early 2015, Nitro Circus rider Josh Sheehan landed the first triple backflip, yet another trick deemed impossible by many, on a custom ramp/dirt setup at Travis Pastrana's \u201cPastranaland\u201d complex in Maryland. he had previously practiced the trick onto a large air cushion at the Maryland complex, using the same custom ramp built for the stunt.",
            "At the Nitro World Games in 2016, Greg Duffy landed the first double front flip.",
            "FMX riders typically use much of the same riding gear as MX racers. This includes a helmet, goggles, gloves, boots, jersey, neck brace, chest protector, and MX pants. They may supplement this with elbow and knee pads. Riders may also choose to wear 'body armour' to protect the chest and legs when performing the most dangerous of tricks, as did Travis Pastrana when performing his double backflips.",
            "Riders use modified motocross bikes with aftermarket parts to lower weight and improve performance.  Riders will often shave down the seat foam to give a wider range of motion and better grip on the seat. Steering stabilizers are also common and help keep the front tire running straight when tricks requiring the rider to let go of the handlebars are performed.  Many riders will also shorten the width of the handlebars, to make it easier to put the legs on the bars, like such tricks as the 'heelclicker' or 'rodeo'. Excess cables, such as brakes and clutch cables are usually redirected away from the bars, to avoid riders getting their boots caught on the bike. The engine and mechanical details of an FMX bike are fairly stock, not needing the fine-tuning of a racing bike. Riders may also choose to have 'lever' on their handlebars to help then when performing 'Kiss Of Death Backflips.' A 'lever' is usually a metal plate or pipe coming off the handlebars, and going in front of the riders wrist or lower arm to stop the rider from rotating during the flips, but letting the bike continue to move.  Bikes have aftermarket performance pipes that give more power.  The bike must have very strong suspension and very high-quality tires."

            "Spend any time around the boroughs of New York, especially the Bronx and Harlem, and you\u2019ll spot cyclists who spend more time on one wheel than two. A ride that starts with a couple riders can snowball into an impromptu jam session of wheelies, with riders hopping on and off the pegs, jumping between the seat and the handlebars, and sometimes even standing on the frame with no hands (aka \"surfing\").",
            "How do these groups form? \"We make our signal call, which is 'EEEEEER',\" explains cyclist Tyron Robinson, emitting a sound that resembles a sticky bike tire braking. \"And then they come join our pack.\"",
            "These days, you can find examples of these acrobatics on Instagram, where some riders have racked up hundreds of thousands of followers with their clips. Some riders will roll down the street without a wheel in the front fork, flaunting its utter uselessness for athletes of their caliber. Another, more controversial trick is the \"swerve,\" which involves moving towards a lamppost or an oncoming bus, then swerving at the last moment\u2014all on one wheel.",
            "In recent years, street trick cyclists in the city have been gravitating overwhelmingly to one bike: the Big Ripper, a particularly chunky-looking adaptation of a model that hit the market in the late 1970s. The Big Ripper is a sensible option for New York. Its single gear allows for a quick start off the line, and its oversized wheels minimize the risks of being swallowed by a pothole.",
            "Riders customize them with oversized tires, multicolor spokes, foam frame covers, and even patterned grip tape for the pegs. But no matter how it's dressed, it\u2019s the Big Ripper's lightweight BMX frame that makes it the perfect trick bike. Still, to attribute the skills of these riders to the Big Ripper would be akin to crediting a Dixon Ticonderoga with a perfect score on the SATs.",
            "\"I get on a bike, I wheelie it\u2014that's it,\u201d said Robinson, a 17-year-old known on Instagram as CCS_TYYY. With over 48,000 followers, Robinson is one of New York's notable Big Ripper riders. He's also the founder of Caution Cycle Squad (CCS), a group for young riders affiliated with the Cycle Squad Maniaccs, a more adult-centric crew that has been around since 2007. \"It's all unity, and everyone respects one another,\u201d Robinson said. \"Everybody has different talents at what they do.\u201d",
            "Both crews are part of a larger movement: Bike Life. It's an informal coalition of street riders from diverse backgrounds and skill levels, one that welcomes riders of all ages and is completely agnostic of bike brands. To join, you \"simply grab your bike and ride,\u201d said Mohammed Trawally, a rider from Cycle Squad Maniaccs also known as MoBlocks. \"It's a bunch of kids, a bunch of adults. You got MTA employees, Crips and Bloods and Latin Kings that ride together. It's brotherhood.\u201d",
            "Trawally is one of four Cycle Squad Maniaccs now sponsored by SE Bikes, the Big Ripper's manufacturer. According to Trawally, it all started with Dblocks, a Cycle Squad Maniaccs member widely regarded as the originator of many of the street riding tricks you see in New York today.",
            "\"I used to be a videographer back then, and the person posting up on YouTube,\u201d Trawally said. \"So we was just recording videos, and next thing you know, [SE brand manager] Todd Lyons seen Dblocks and said, 'Oh, snap, that's cool.' Todd Lyons flew Dblocks out to Cali, and I guess from there it was on.\"",
            "Trawally said the Big Ripper's popularity has a lot to do with the Maniaccs' early adoption of the bike. \"We created this mess,\u201d he said, laughing. Still, he's glad the Maniaccs have inspired other groups to form and carry the Bike Life message to younger age groups.",
            "Despite ongoing tensions with police and motorists alike (Robinson calmly mentioned a ride where one driver attempted to run one of his friends off the road), riding offers NYC youths a sense of community both online and on the street, as well as a sense of purpose. \"I don't know what I'd be doing if I was not riding bikes,\u201d said Christian Green, another CCS rider.",
            "The Big Ripper is an adaptation of the PK Ripper, an iconic bike in BMX culture. Scot Breithaupt, the late founder of SE Bikes, had a penchant for naming his bikes after their riders. One of those riders was Perry Kramer, the hall-of-fame BMX rider who rode for his company in the late 70s and early 80s. When Jeff Utterback, another rider, left SE to start another BMX bike company, SE modified and adapted Utterback's model, the JU6, for Kramer. The year it launched, Kramer won a national BMX title on this bike\u2014dubbed the PK Ripper\u2014as did his teammates Stu Thomsen and Rod Beckering.",
            "In a conversation with VICE, Kramer attributed the PK Ripper's popularity to its initial victories on the track, though the name probably also has something to do with it. \"Even though it's got my initials on it, it just sounds cool,\u201d he said, adding that Breithaupt \"was a brilliant guy as far as naming things.\u201d \"There was never just a bike called a PK Ripper in red. It was always 'Rippin' Red,' or 'Blazing Blue,' or 'Winning White.' The forks on the bike were never just SE Racing forks; they were 'Landing Gear' forks.\u201d",
            "There's also the bike's distinct \"floval\u201d frame: flat on the sides and oval on the top and bottom part of the frame tubing. The PK Ripper was one of the first BMX frames to use aluminum instead of steel, resulting in a frame that looks large and bulky but is surprisingly light. \"That bike helped elevate me as much as I helped elevate that bike,\u201d Kramer said.",
            "Still, Kramer said he's surprised by the bike's continued popularity. \"There [were] other bikes that were named after other riders, so I never thought in my wildest dreams that this bike would live on like it did,\u201d he said. Though not everyone who is familiar with the PK Ripper and the Big Ripper will know who Kramer is, both models have certainly left their mark on pop culture: Over the years, SE Bikes has made special-edition rippers in collaboration with Public Enemy, Marshawn Lynch, and the streetwear brand The Hundreds. In 2017, Tyler, the Creator even shouted out the PK Ripper in Frank Ocean's \"Biking.\" (Tyler also collaborated with SE bikes for a special \"Golf Wang Flyer.\u201d)",
            "The Big Ripper, which SE put into production in 2009, has an even larger frame than the PK Ripper and even larger tires (it basically looks like someone photoshopped a BMX bike to be bigger). SE created the bike in 2008 to accommodate the size of Christopher Boykin, the late co-star of TV show Rob & Big.",
            "Though it's been a while since he's frequented the dirt courses of his youth, Kramer is still an avid street rider. Based on the West Coast, he often attends the 4130 Subway series, a monthly rideout from Hollywood to Downtown Los Angeles. In some ways, these giant organized cruises, which happen all over the world, aren't that far off from Critical Mass, another cyclist-led movement where riders reclaim the streets while benefiting from safety in numbers. Trawally and both CCS riders cite this rationale as part of the impetus for riding in large groups; after all, solo riders are more susceptible to falling into a car's blind spot or getting run off the road by aggressive drivers.",
            "Just a few years ago, Trawally said, it was a big deal to get 30 riders together in New York. He estimates that the latest rideout, which took place on September 15 and was aptly named \u201cEverybodysRideout19,\u201d was roughly 1,500 deep. But as the movement gains traction, these mass rides seem to be attracting attention from law enforcement.",
            "On September 15, a location was shared on Instagram, prompting thousands of riders to begin trickling south from Fort George to Times Square. I hopped on a Citi Bike in Harlem, hoping to intersect the group on its way downtown, and spotted several officers on bicycles yelling at a traffic guard: \"Which way did the bikes go?!\u201d Later, I'd see one pink Ripper loaded into a police car, on Amsterdam Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, though the rider was nowhere in sight. Reached via email, the NYPD could not confirm whether this was the result of a crash or an arrest.",
            "The laws around cycling in the city are complex. \u201cThe most important concept is that, generally, the laws that govern motorists also govern bicyclists, according to Scott Charnas, a lawyer who often represents New York cyclists. \u201cThere are exceptions, but that is the general rule.\u201d One law specific to cyclists states that where there is a visible and usable bike lane, riders must use it. They're are also prohibited from traveling \u201cmore than two abreast\u201d on shoulders, bike lanes, or shared-use pathways, and must ride single file when overtaking or passing pedestrians, vehicles, or other cyclists.",
            "\"Given the above,\u201d Charnas said, \"a group of, say, 50 bicyclists riding 10 abreast down the street would be in violation of several of these laws.\u201d Still, Charnas stressed that the degree to which these laws are actually enforced across the different boroughs can vary. \"I can say that much of enforcement is dependent on the judgment, some might say whims, of individual police officers\u2014unless the mayor or some other politician pushes for enforcement of some law or other because someone just got killed and it was all over the media.\u201d",
            "In the past couple years, the Maniaccs have noticed officers attending their rideouts, some of whom seem to know individual riders by name. \"You got cops at these rideouts trying to grab these kids and cutting them off or sometimes even tackling them off their bikes,\u201d Trawally said. \"They get close to you. They will hurt you just to get you,\u201d he said. The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment from VICE asking if such tactics were consistent with how the department deals with rideouts.",
            "Robinson expressed a similar concern about the police attention. \"I feel like that gets unsafe, because we gotta panic, and then there's other cars that we might run into,\u201d he said.",
            "Police in Harlem, with an apparently confiscated BMX bike",
            "Recently, a video that surfaced showing an NYPD officer attempting to break the back spokes of a Big Ripper caused a great deal of frustration in the New York biking community. Green, one of the CCS riders, claims to have witnessed the incident. After the group was asked to leave the Bronx Terminal mall, Green said, they relocated nearby, deciding where to go next. At this time, he said, the officer told them to leave the second area. \"And then he took out his baton and did all that in the video,\u201d he said. In a statement to VICE, the NYPD said the incident is under internal review.",
            "CCS Ty and CCS CJ",
            "Bike safety advocates admit that trick riding and mass rideouts can be dangerous. \"As a teacher of safe cycling, I don't encourage the particular style of riding they do\u2014with the wheelies and cutting through traffic and all,\" said Courtney Williams, a New York-based bicycle advocacy consultant behind The Brown Bike Girl. Still, Williams laments the fact that \"the well-being of the Big Ripper / 'ride out kids' are not part of the conversation in safety.\u201d The problem, Williams said, fits in with \"a greater American societal tradition of disregard for black and brown POC until they pose a nuisance to mainstream society's sense of order or goals. Then suddenly there is 'concern.'\"",
            "And then there are issues specific to New York. New York is often mentioned on national \"most bikeable\" city lists for new additions like bike-first stoplights, miles of bike lanes, and the Central Park car ban. But clumping all the Boroughs together paints an incomplete picture. PeopleForBikes, a nonprofit that ranks cities by their bike friendliness, placed New York City at #11 last year. In 2019, the organization split the city into its individual Boroughs, and only Manhattan and Brooklyn made the list. In a comment to Streetsblog, PeopleForBikes noted \u201ca lack of progress being made in the Bronx and Staten Island and \u2026 parts of Queens.\u201d",
            "Both Green and Robinson mentioned the dearth of bike lanes in their neighborhood as a reason why they have to ride on the street. Many of these young cyclists ride on the road out of necessity, not just for fun\u2014and where else can they ride if the sidewalk is off-limits, and the bike lanes\u2014if they even exist\u2014are often obstructed by parked vehicles?",
            "Despite this lose-lose situation, Green said he's noticed that when crashes do happen in the city, it's often the rider who gets the blame. Commenting on a bike messenger who was killed by a truck driver earlier this year, NYPD officer Carlos Negron told Gothamist, \"Maybe if she had been on the bike lane, she'd still be alive.\u201d",
            "For supporters of the movement, though, the presence of these riders is a public reminder that streets are not just a place for cars.",
            "\"Obviously nobody's advocating for swerving in front of buses or violating pedestrian space, but more than anything, bike advocates want to reclaim city streets from cars so everybody has access to them,\" said Eben Weiss, a writer and bike advocate who often writes under the name The Bike Snob. \"While in a perfect world we'd all be a bunch of law-abiding Dudley Do-Rights, I can't help rooting for anything and anybody that undermines driver complacency and entitlement and gets people in the city out there riding.\u201d",
            "As of the time of writing this article, 23 people have died while cycling in New York City this year. Green and Robinson are used to hearing about bike fatalities, but they seem largely unfazed. \"We basically risk our lives to ride bikes,\u201d said Robinson.",
            "After all, once you're able to hold a wheelie indefinitely, you don't want to get off your bike.",
            "\"When you do something and you start to get good at it, then it makes you want to do it even more, because you're just getting better and better,\u201d says Kramer. \u201cThese kids go out there and it's contagious. And they get other kids out there, and it's pretty cool. It's really cool.\""

            "Sal Masekela and fans give us there thoughts on Mike Metzger's first dirt bike backflip in X Games competition.",
            "Twenty Years, 20 Firsts celebrates the 20-year legacy of the X Games in action sports with a collection of 20 of the most iconic first-trick moments in X Games history. The fan-vote component for the top moment concluded with Elena Hight taking the win just after X Games Austin, but the \"World Of X Games\" 20 Firsts show will count down the top 20 moments July 19 on ABC.",
            "It's hard to believe the first backflips on motorcycles in competition were landed just 12 years ago. Fast-forward to today, and freestyle motocross riders regularly land double backflips, front flips, body varials and other eye-popping aerial antics that wouldn't have been dreamed of a decade ago. But when Mike Metzger landed the first backflip in an X Games competition at X Games Philadelphia in 2002, the FMX world would never be the same.",
            "\"It's crazy what we all do in FMX, especially those of us with families,\" Metzger said. \"We put the selfish helmet on to go out and risk our lives entertaining people because we love it, knowing that the most dangerous thing anybody could ever want to do is get on a dirt bike and jump it the way we do. But before we put on those helmets, we all pray, every one of us. For me, that worked my whole life, thank God.\"",
            "A longtime fan of Evel Knievel, Metzger started racing at age 6 and became obsessed with movie stuntmen on motorbikes in 1986, the year the movie \"Rad\" came out. \"It was the first time I'd ever seen anybody do a backflip on a BMX bike,\" he said. \"Right then and there I remember thinking, 'That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to flip my motorcycle.'\"",
            "X Games VIII was where Metzger rewrote the rules of freestyle competition. Before that, the backflip was a rumor. After, it was mandatory.",
            "Metzger was one of the first riders to start messing around with BMX-inspired freestyle tricks on his motocross bike. His competitive rival, Carey Hart, had come close to landing the backflip in competition before, but broke his foot in the attempt at the X Games in 2001. Then in 2002, Caleb Wyatt made history as the first rider to successfully backflip a full-size 250cc motorcycle, a few months before X Games, giving Metzger the final nudge he needed. Two weeks before X Games VIII both Metzger and Travis Pastrana landed the first backflips in any competition at the Gravity Games, according to ESPN Stats & Research. Pastrana finished first, and Metzger finished second.",
            "Metzger started landing the flips in the dunes by his house, and then let it be known in advance that he would be bringing the backflip to X Games in Philadelphia. \"When you know in your head it's time to do something, you have to go for it,\" he says, remembering the accomplishment with a shrug.",
            "\"The first day I did it off a freestyle ramp was July 2nd -- I'll never forget it -- and ESPN was there to film it for the commercials leading up to X Games,\" Metzger said. He didn't have access to a foam pit big enough for motorcycles in those days, so attempting it meant full commitment.",
            "\"The very first time, I landed it and rode away from it, and the camera guys missed it. I guess nobody really thought I was going to go for it,\" Metzger said. \"After that, I made damn sure they were rolling, and landed it again on my second and fifth tries, with a couple crashes in between, before calling it a day. Two days later, on the Fourth of July, I landed 21 in a row without falling.\"",
            "Those fireworks didn't do much to calm his nerves about bringing the trick to X Games, however. \"It wasn't that I was worried about landing it,\" he said. \"I knew once I did it, I was going to have to do it again and again for the rest of my life for as long as I was riding freestyle motocross. I knew it was going to be a game-changer for me and for everybody in the sport, and that terrified me. But that's what X Games had always been about: bringing something new to the table. It really did change things forever.\"",
            "Despite all the hype he'd helped create, Metzger played it cool on the day of the event and rode conservatively to make sure he made it to the big show. Then, right before finals, he got an even bigger idea.",
            "\"I went out there to walk the course and decided the best metal ramp for the backflip was the 45-foot jump, but then right behind that was an 80-foot dirt jump that was the most perfect freestyle jump I'd ever seen. I thought, 'If I don't flip that, I'm missing out.' I knew I was going to flip the first jump, and in the back of my mind I was thinking, 'When that second one comes around, I just might go for it,'\" he said.",
            "\"I'd be out practicing on our motocross track, doing can cans, whipping it, playing around,\" Metzger said in 2002. \"My dad comes home from work, like, 'What are you doing?!' I'm having fun, doing what I seen these BMXers do in BMX Plus magazine.\"",
            "Travis Pastrana, who had won gold when Moto X Freestyle made its X Games debut in 1999 and won again in 2000 and 2001, was out with an injury that year. He watched from the announcer's booth as Metzger landed back-to-back backflips.",
            "Metzger won gold in Moto X Freestyle that day, then landed a backflip no-footer to take Moto X Best Trick gold. He also won silver in Moto X Step Up, and said the prize money from that weekend was the biggest paycheck of his life.",
            "He competed for nearly another decade and collected three more X Games medals before a training crash forced him to pull out of X Games Los Angeles 2011 with broken vertebrae in his back and neck, two broken collarbones and a lacerated kidney.",
            "Metzger now works as a tattoo artist at Renaissance Studios in San Clemente, Calif., near Camp Pendleton. He says military folks frequently come into the shop asking for the \"Godfather of FMX\" when they're looking for new ink, as do many of today's top FMX riders. Metzger never did love that nickname, but says he's still a fan of FMX. These days he says he's content to sit back and let others take the risks.",
            "\"I'm honored I was able to hang in there as long as I did, especially with all my injuries, and to have made my contributions. But it definitely got to where it was all too crazy to keep up with,\" Metzger said. \"I'm completely retired now. I don't even own a dirt bike anymore. It hurts too damn much. I don't miss being hurt all the time.\"",

            "If it had wheels, it went flying",
            "Legendary motocross and freestyle dirt bike rider Travis Pastrana brought Nitro Circus\u2014the daredevil stunt variety show\u2014to the SAP Center in San Jose on Thursday night. In tow were some of the most daring and talented extreme sports athletes in the world, performing a wide range of gravity-defying maneuvers for an amped-up Bay Area audience.",
            "You may recognize Pastrana as the stunt performer who replicated three of Evel Knievel\u2019s most famous jumps, earlier this year in Las Vegas. Nitro Circus keeps with that same sense of high-risk vertical challenge. The show involves a host of sizable ramps and landing pads that give the athletes room to progress their stunts from night to night. So while the circus showcases some stunning choreography, many of the stunts are active challenges that have evolved over the course of time. In fact, this particular tour of Nitro Circus has already seen its collection of \u201cfirsts\u201d and Thursday night was no different (see below).",
            "In case you missed the action, we sketched out the highflying highlights in vivid visual form. Take a look\u2026.",
            "It\u2019s been 17 years since back-flips were first being done on dirt bikes, but the one performed by Bruce Cook at SAP was very different. In 2014, Bruce crashed while attempting the world\u2019s first double front-flip on a dirt bike, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Nine months later, he was back on a dirt bike, and only one month after that he was attempting back-flips again. At Nitro Circus, Bruce rides a custom-built dirt bike that keeps him strapped in while he performs his stunts.",
            "If you can put wheels on it, chances are it was flying through the sky at SAP. There was a flying trash can, boogie board, skis, a children\u2019s toy car and even a VW Bus replica. Seeing these objects piloted thirty feet into the air was not something many people expected to see, but was met with big cheers.",
            "Front-flips are a rare trick on a dirt bike that very few dare to attempt (let alone master) but Greg Duffy is one of those rare athletes. On Thursday night, Greg pulled a front-flip nac-nac, one of only two variations attempted at Nitro Circus.",
            "Ryan Williams has performed a number of \u201cWorld\u2019s first\u201d and his bike-flip is no exception. Ryan first performed this uncanny mid-air bike twirl last year and has since made it one of his signature tricks (and a standout highlight of Nitro Circus). His stunt came in second place for Best Trick of the event and Ryan even tried to add a combination of bike-flip to tail-whip on his second run, but was unsuccessful.",
            "A world\u2019s first at Nitro Games on Thursday night was the X-Up Triple Back-flip: the first triple back-flip variation. Triple back-flips have become a highlight of Nitro Circus, but the progression started with the first variation by Brandon Schmidt. The X-Up Triple Back-flip won Brandon best trick of the night on Thursday.",
            "The Nitro Circus: You Got This tour has two stops left on its North American journey before ending in Denver, Colorado, on October 16th. The Nitro Circus tours extensively through much of the world and has just announced a permanent residency at Bally\u2019s Las Vegas starting in 2019.",

            "BMX stands for  \u2018Bicycle Motocross\u2019 so it should come as little surprise that BMX bikes themselves are best known for being piloted over jumps and ripping around berms, much like their petrol-powered cousins.",
            "BMX originated in the early 1970\u2019s when kids would mimic motocross races on their bicycles, complete with a number fastened to the front of the bike. They would take to dirt \u2018tracks\u2019 and race each other in a similar fashion to their motocross idols.",
            "As expected, the racing got more competitive, the demands on equipment became higher and more specialized, and subcultures naturally formed around street and freestyle BMX.",
            "Fast forward to today and BMX has come completely of its own, with BMX racing being UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale, the governing body of cycling), sanctioned and featured in the Olympic Games. Freestyle BMX has professional riders and teams supported by huge sponsorship competing at adrenalin-fueled events such as the X-games.",
            "Feeling spoilt for choice with what BMX to buy? We are here to clear things up, spell out the differences and arm you with the knowledge to confidently purchase the right BMX bike to suit your needs.",
            "",
            "",
            "Freestyle BMX bikes are designed to withstand the stresses that come with performing stunts on street features, dirt jumps, and skate parks. This means that the frame materials, wheels, and components must be equally optimized for both strength and ease of maneuverability. Race BMX bikes are optimized for speed and acceleration, so are often made from lighter materials and feature different geometry to ensure they are stable, stiff and nimble at speed.",
            "Within freestyle BMX there are several sub-disciplines that fall under the umbrella of the term \u2018freestyle\u2019. With the exception of flatland, there is a lot of crossover within these disciplines, so choosing an all-rounder bike that is categorized as freestyle will likely be the most versatile option.",
            "Park: Park riding refers to riding in skate parks, which despite the name, are frequented by BMX riders almost as often as skaters. Park riding also extends to BMX specific indoor parks for riders only, which are commonly referred to as \u2018ramps\u2019.",
            "Street: As the name would suggest, street riders get creative with urban infrastructure such as stairs and rails to perform highly skilled tricks and turns. Riders will always be on the lookout for good \u2018spots\u2019 to try new tricks.",
            "Flatland:  Quite a niche style, flatland occurs with no external features and all the tricks are done with the bike by the rider. Often described as \u2018breakdancing\u2019 on the bike, riders pivot and balance the bike with on a hard flat surface.",
            "Trails/Dirt Jumping:  Occurs on purpose build dirt jumps and berms. These riders look at getting big air and linking up jumps in to perform tricks.",
            "Race:  BMX racing occurs on purpose built courses which are made from hard-packed, well-groomed dirt or bitumen and often feature a mixture of undulating terrain and long jumps. Because BMX race bikes are designed with a sole purpose in mind, they are often unsuitable for use in other BMX riding disciplines.",

            "Freestyle and entry-level race BMX bikes are predominately made from a steel composition known as Chromoly 4130 (chromo for short). Chromo is an alloyed steel which offers superior strength properties when compared to cheaper, \u2018Hi-tensile\u2019 steels typically found on lower end and department store bikes. Chromo steel is able to be \u2018butted\u2019, meaning it can be made to be thinner and therefore lighter in the middle of the tubing, and reinforced around the ends and joins for strength.",
            "Steel is the material of choice for these bikes as it is highly resistant to fatigue (important considering all the hits these bikes take!), is easy to repair and offers some additional compliance to the ride which adds a little more comfort and reduces pressure on the body of the rider.",
            "For BMX racing, the preference is for stiffer, lightweight frames meaning aluminium is the material of choice.  If you are serious about your racing and want to get the extra edge, carbon fiber frames are growing in popularity amongst elite BMX racers as it reduces weight even further and has vibration dampening properties not found in aluminium.",
            "For more information on bike frame materials, check out our comprehensive guide.",

            "Freestyle BMX bikes are ridden by kids, teenagers and adults alike; therefore, although the wheel size stays consistent, the frame size can change subtly to suit the riding style and height of the rider. Most freestyle BMX bikes off the shop floor will come with a 21in top tube so that riders have enough room to swing the bike underneath them if performing airborne tricks, as well as a shorter seat stay which is easier to whip around.",
            "Flatland frames are typically the only exception to this as they tend to be lighter and have shorter tubing all round for better balance and control. They also have a much steeper head angle and 3/8\" dropouts for smaller rear axles.",
            "On race bikes,  slacker head angle and longer wheelbase put the rider further back on the bike, which allows for improved stability and handling at speed. Race frame sizes come in a wider range to suit the rider age spread that BMX racing sees.",
            "",
            "",
            "The \u2018standard\u2019 size for a BMX wheel is 20in, which is much smaller than a mountain bike or road bike. Even smaller 16in or 18in wheels can be found on kids bikes, and a larger 22in or 24in wheel can be seen on some \u2018trail\u2019 BMX bikes used for dirt jumping.  However, it is safe to assume that \u2018BMX\u2019 will generally refer to a bike with 20in wheels.",
            "Racing BMX bikes fall into two categories, depending on wheel size. The first is 20in - the most common, the second is 24in or \u2018cruiser\u2019. Cruiser bikes are popular amongst taller or older riders, and also offer more stability.",
            "Because racing BMX demands lightening-quick acceleration out of starting gates, the wheels are lighter than in freestyle BMX.",
            "",
            "",
            "The standard rim width is 32mm for freestyle bikes. For those riders who expect they will put a few more hard-hits into the wheels, can opt for a wider 36mm rim. Rims are made of aluminium and can be single, double or triple walled, the more layers of metal provide more structural support, albeit at the penalty of increased weight. The ideal standard for a majority of riders is double wall as it is a good balance of strength and weight.",
            "Advanced riders who put more demand on their equipment will generally choose to have wheels built up aftermarket to suit their requirements specifically and be more selective with rims and spoke count.",
            "",
            "",
            "Spoke count is another thing to consider when choosing a BMX or buying some new wheels. Spokes are \u2018laced\u2019 from the hub to the rim and rely on tension to stay true and strong. The number of spokes contributes to the strength ( as well as the weight) of the complete wheel.  A 36 spoke wheel will suffice for most riders on a freestyle BMX bike. More advanced riders or heavier riders may opt for up a 48 spoke wheel. Most spokes are made from a steel wire and are the same thickness all the way through, but if you see something referring to \u2018butted\u2019 spokes, like butted frames, this means that the spokes are thinner in the middle and thicker at the end for added strength but reduced weight.",
            "Race BMX wheels will be anywhere between a 28 to 36 spoke build and have alloy rims engineered to shave weight where possible.",

            "Being the first point of contact to the riding surface, tire choice will affect the speed (rolling resistance), grip and handling of the bike. For street and park riding, smooth rolling, wider tires are preferable. Premium BMX tires can accept pressure of up to 110psi, which will roll faster than a lower inflated tire and offer rim protection when under load after hard landings.",
            "Dirt jumpers will opt for something with more tread for traction on the dirt and run their tires at a lower pressure for better grip. Wider than a race tire, look for 20in x 2.1 for better stability and more surface area. The good thing is, tires are easily swapped and changed, so you can choose to change them if you feel the need.",
            "Tyres for racing are usually narrower in suit the narrower rim profile and reduce weight, as well as roll faster on the racetrack.",
            "The centerpiece of a wheel, BMX hubs house the bearings on which the wheels spin and are typically made from alloy. Bikes or wheelsets at lower price points will feature open-cage ball bearings, which whilst cost-effective, are susceptible to more damage and are less durable than the alternative, a sealed or cartridge bearing. Cartridge bearings have the small steel balls kept within a sealed unit, and as such are protected from becoming contaminated by dirt and debris. Choosing a BMX bike or wheelset that features sealed bearings will mean a smoother and more reliable ride. The standard BMX axle size is 14mm,  with flatland BMX bikes opting for 3/8\u201d (10mm) axles for weight savings. The axle fits through the center of the hub and then slides into the dropouts in the frame to keep the wheel in place,  fastened with bolts. BMX bikes do not use quick-release systems.",
            "BMX hubs come in four different types;",
            "Cassette: Essentially the same mechanism as a mountain or road bike, the cassette hub uses an independent driver fitted onto the hub shell. Weighing less and generally easier to install and service, cassette hubs are the most popular choice for BMX bikes in both race and freestyle disciplines.",
            "Freecoaster: Freecoaster hubs divide opinions in the BMX world, and are often only selected in order to help with certain tricks and are often only used by flatland riders. The point of difference is that freecoaster hubs have an internal clutch system that allows the rider to coast backward, so the wheel will actually drive backward without the cranks turning. Freecoasters are distinctly quiet when pedaling but will elicit a \u2018clicking\u2019 sound when coasting. Because of their more intricate design requiring more parts, these hubs are typically more expensive and weigh a bit more than a standard cassette hub.",
            "Freewheel: These types of hubs used to be the standard, but have mostly been phased out in favor of cassette hubs. Freewheel hubs have the sprocket (sometimes referred to as the \u2018driver\u2019) threaded directly onto the hub shell. The smallest gearing available for a freewheel is 13-tooth, which is limits gearing options for freestyle riders (more about gear ratios and sprockets below).",
            "Coaster: Coaster hubs are also known as \u2018back pedal brakes\u2019 whereby the ride will engage the brake when they pedal backward. Coaster hubs will almost never be seen on a freestyle BMX bike, with the exception of kids and entry-level bikes.",
            "",
            "",
            "You may hear the words sprocket and chainring interchanged, but to keep it clear here we will refer to the chainring as the front ring attached to the cranks, and the sprocket as the rear driver attached to the hub.",
            "Although BMX bikes don\u2019t have multiple gears, the thing to consider is the number of teeth on the chainring and sprocket and the ideal pairing of these, also known as the \u2018gear ratio\u2019.",
            "To determine the gear ratio, you will need some basic mathematics. Simply divide the number of teeth on the chainring (say, 25) by the number on the sprocket (nine) and you will be left with 2.78 meaning the rear wheel will rollover approximately two-and-three-quarter times for every rotation of the chainring.  The lower the number, the easier to pedal, the higher, the harder it is to pedal (requires more force).",
            "In order to ride out of tricks and better clearance over features, the trend for freestyle BMX is to have a smaller chainring/sprocket combination than traditional or race BMX\u2019s.  A common gear ratio is 25/9 (referring to the chainring/sprocket respectively). This means it takes little effort for the rider to accelerate quickly into a trick or a jump, but means they are compromised on top and speed and power.",
            "BMX race bikes need to allow the rider to generate explosive power, so a much larger chainring is used. Gearing choice on a BMX race bike gets quite in depth the more progressive the riding becomes, and because there are discrepancies between wheel sizes and tire widths, it goes beyond simply gear ratio.",
            "BMX racers will be choosing and changing gear ratios to match the rhythm and demand of different race tracks, or simply to suit their physiology or ability level. When looking to purchase, it is safe to trust the gearing for race bikes will be approximately 55 gear inches, which is likely to suit the majority of riders.",

            "",
            "BMX cranks come in one-piece, two-piece or three-piece units.",
            "One-piece cranks have the left and right crankarms and spindle all as one piece of steel. The arms thinner and are much more flimsy, only seen nowadays on kids bikes for very cheap BMX bikes.",
            "For two-piece configurations, the spindle is fixed to only one crank arm and the other is separate. These tend to be thicker and sturdier than the latter. Three-piece cranks are much stronger and have both crank arms and the spindle as three separate units Ideally, choose a BMX with a two or three-piece Chromoly crank for strength and durability.",
            "Crank lengths can vary from 145mm up to 190mm - however most freestyle riders will opt for shorter cranks to allow for clearance when performing tricks, a common choice is 165mm. Race BMX crank size is dependent on rider height, and will sometimes be made of aluminium to reduce weight.",
            "The pedal of choice for all types of freestyle BMX is a wide platformed plastic pedal to reduce weight and are generally inexpensive. An added bonus is plastic is slightly less harsh than metal pedals should an (inevitable) blow to the shins occur.  The pedal axle will be 9/16in on two three-piece cranks and 1/2in on one-piece cranks. It is important to know what size you have buying new pedals!",
            "The preference for racing is to use SPD, or clip-in pedals. These pedals provide the rider with the ability to generate maximum power for and get up to speed as the gate drops.",
            "Of course, if you are new to BMX, a flat pedal will suffice while building confidence in handling and gate starts.",
            "Saddles do not play as much of an important role in the setup of BMX bikes, so the preference for saddles is for minimalism, even so far as to having saddles that are completely plastic. Entry level BMX bikes will have a bit more cushion and larger surface area as again the assumption is that the rider will be sitting down and pedaling more than an advanced rider who will be floating above the saddle a lot.",
            "Rails: Just like a mountain or road bike, the has rails on either side that sit in a clamp attached to the seat post.",
            "Pivotal saddles: The saddle is connected to the seatpost vias a single bolt that goes through the middle of the saddle and into the seatpost.",
            "Integrated seat/seatpost: Some manufacturers produce a complete unit that is the seat and seatpost integrated into one. Not ideal for sitting on, but reduces weight significantly.",

            "Bars found on 24-inch BMX bikes might not have a crossbar and have significantly less rise to account for the higher stack due to the larger frame and bigger wheels.",
            "Flatland handlebars usually have a very minimal sweep so the bars feel basically the same when pointed forward or backward, as well as a low crossbar so riders can swing their leg over for tricks.",
            "BMX bikes will typically feature rim-brakes, where the pads connect to the rim to slow momentum. Freestyle bikes are equipped U-brake that sits inside the rear triangle and out of the way of the rider. Many freestyle bikes may also come with a \u2018detangler\u2019 or \u2018Gyro\u2019 braking system for the rear brake.",
            "Distinguishable by the division of two cables around a mechanism fitted at the headtube,  the detangler allows the bars to spin a full 360 degrees without the brake cable getting tangled. This is incredibly helpful for advancing tricks such as barspins and tailwhips.  If these sorts of tricks are not going to be on your radar, a normal brake will suffice.",

These helmets will have minimal vents and can extend to covering the ears as well. This is to take into account that BMX riders may take a stack while attempting a trick and are at risk of landing in any direction. When racing BMX, there are rules and restrictions around equipment on the racetrack. In training and competition, a full-faced helmet must be worn along with long pants and long-sleeved jersey.",

            "Pegs: Pegs are metal cylinders (or sometimes dense plastic) that are fitted to the axles of the BMX bike so the rider can balance on them for tricks in flatland, or perform grinds on rails or ledges in street and park riding. Flatland will usually have pegs on all 4 axles, whereas street riders will have just one side with pegs on the front and rear. Pegs are strictly banned in BMX racing.",
