Not having a large house may mean preparing party games outside the home, in parks, woods or in an indoor playground. An action-packed afternoon of fun and games can be had whatever the time of year. However, it is always important that the children can move a lot, in order to accommodate their need to run around and play.\nWeather permitting, winter offers an excellent opportunity to play games in the snow. Go as sledging, build an igloo or make a snowman. Spring and summer, on the other hand, are great for races or tackling an obstacle course.", "The true classics include hide-and-seek, hot-and-cold, egg-and-spoon races (also great with Kinder Surprise Eggs), sack races and tug-of-war \u2013 these games are popular with younger children, in particular.

The kids run around the chairs, one after the other in a ring, to the sound of party music. Then, when the music is suddenly switched off, all the children have to sit on a chair as fast as possible.

Good guest manners begin as soon as you receive the invitation.\u201d", "Both experts recommend responding within one to two days of receiving the invitation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to handwrite a reply on stationary.

I would stay away from asking if you can bring your other children,\u201d D\u2019Amico says.", "If you need to attend the party with your child who was invited and can\u2019t get a sitter, it\u2019s best to decline the invitation.", "Post Senning says that if a parent is unsure whether or not to leave kids alone or should stay, it is advisable to ask the host. It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable question and the parent will appreciate you asking rather than assuming.", "If you do stay, take advantage of the opportunity to model good manners for your child.

That's where, instead of getting a gift from each attendee, you request that each person contribute $5 that the birthday child can then use to purchase a bigger, more special gift. Parents of the attendees like them because they don't have to spend a lot of time or money selecting a gift to buy, and parents of the birthday child like them because it cuts down on the amount of clutter \u2014 and possibly unused or unwanted toys \u2014 that enter the house. But what about the birthday kid? Some research shows that fiver parties (or, if you're Canadian, a \"two toonie\" party, after the Canadian two-dollar coin) are actually beneficial for children.", "Lots and lots of toys don't just clutter up the playroom \u2014 they also unfocus your kids' minds. \"Particularly with younger children, the fewer toys they have the more they benefit developmentally,\" says Susan Newman, Ph.D. social psychologist and author of Little Things Long Remembered: Making Your Children Feel Special Every Day. \"In a study of toddler play, for example, the children were given either four or 16 toys. The children with four toys played more imaginatively, in more varied ways and for longer periods of time \u2014 all of which is developmentally beneficial.\"", "It might be your natural instinct to shield kids from the idea of money, but an early start is actually better. \"A study published in the Journal of Family Issues found that college students who remembered handling money as kids expressed confidence about their financial skills as young adults,\" says Katie Hurley, LCSW, author of The Happy Kid Handbook. \"While a giant pile of gifts might feel like a lot of fun in the moment, a fiver party actually gives kids the opportunity to think about how to manage money. When kids have the chance to save up for a coveted item, they take pride in their purchase and feel confident about their ability to meet their own financial needs.\"", "That's not just a good deed, it's developmentally beneficial as well. \"Research shows that when people give to charities, it activates the regions of the brain associated with pleasure, social connection, and trust,\" Hurley says. You'll also get a chance to talk with your child about your values, and the causes you feel passionate about as a family. \"This would be instructive in teaching children to be empathic and charitable,\" Dr. Newman says. \"You might also have all the children at the party vote on what cause a portion of the gift should go.\"", "Even though it seems like a win-win \u2014 parents spend less on gifts, and get less junk \u2014 there's still a taboo around requesting cash. There's also something a that could be presumptuous about assuming you're going to get a gift (even though that presumption is totally founded). The important thing is to make sure the wording of the invitation notes that the gift-giver obviously has a choice. Something like:", "If you know what your child is saving for, adding that to the invite might make it a little more satisfying for a would-be gift-giver. There are some that might bristle at the request for cash, but there are others (namely me) who feel this is even better than no-gift parties, because some parents bring gifts to no-gift parties anyway, making the others feel bad for following the rules. \"It removes the competitiveness entirely and equalizes gift-giving field,\" Dr. Newman says.", "While it seems like there's nothing but benefits for your kid, well, there might be some disappointment if your child is used to opening a big pile of birthday presents. \"While school-age children are beginning to understand the concept of money as currency, preschool children might not have the same reaction to opening a card with $5 enclosed,\" Hurley notes. She says that, for the littlest ones, asking for books instead of bills might be the better option.", "", "Then again, there could be a teaching moment in there, too. \"Initially, a child might be disappointed that there's not an assortment of gifts to open,\" Newman says. \"The flip side, of course, is that it\u2019s an opportunity to learn to deal with disappointment.\" Which might be a hard lesson to learn on a birthday, but if you plan your fiver party with your child ahead of time, and talk up the excitement of saving for a bigger gift, they might not have to deal with the birthday blues."]], "https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/unique-birthday-party-ideas-for-kids/": [{"h1": ["40 Unique Birthday Party Ideas for Kids"], "h2": ["Children Birthday Party Ideas"], "h3": ["For 1 Year Old", "For 2 Years Old", "For 3 Years Old", "For 4 Years Old", "For 5 Years Old", "For 6 Years Old", "For 7 Years Old", "For 8 Years Old", "STEM Toys for Children \u2013 Benefits and Ideas", "Pediatric Vital Signs \u2013 What\u2019s Normal for Your Child and What\u2019s Not", "7 Things Every New Parent Needs to Know About Diapering", "Diwali Essay for Kids \u2013 Tips to Write & Samples", "This Traditional Method of Massaging a Baby Can Help in Holistic Growth and Development", "How to Ensure Your Baby Massage Ritual Delivers the Maximum Benefits", "My Unexpectedly Hard Journey of Motherhood as a Single Mom", "A to Z Baby Guide: 25 Things Your Baby Needs to Grow Up Healthy & Strong!", "60 Armenian Names for Boys and Girls", "Pacifier For Babies- Benefits, Risks And Tips To Use Them", "Sanjay Dutt\u2019s Adorable Reunion With His Twins Will Warm Your Heart!", "Guru Nanak Jayanti (Gurpurab) Wishes, Messages and Quotes for Family and...", "Guru Nanak Jayanti (Gurpurab) 2020 \u2013 History, Significance and Celebration", "STEM Toys for Children \u2013 Benefits and Ideas", "Pediatric Vital Signs \u2013 What\u2019s Normal for Your Child and What\u2019s...", "15 Funny Pregnancy Memes to Make You Laugh for Complete 9..."], "h4": ["RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR", "POPULAR POSTS", "LATEST"], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["Last Updated on January 23, 2020", "For every parent, their child\u2019s birthday is a special occasion.

We figured that since our son wasn\u2019t old enough to know the difference, there was no need to spend a small fortune on a party he wouldn\u2019t even remember. However, his third birthday posed more of a challenge because by then he\u2019d reached the age where he was being invited to playmates\u2019 birthday celebrations. We realized that our minimalist family gatherings might be too exclusive and couldn\u2019t compare to some of the more elaborate birthday extravaganzas he\u2019d attended.", "With\u00a0so many parents these days throwing their children expensive, over-the-top birthday parties, it can be difficult for the rest of us\u00a0to keep up. I\u2019ve seen people rent out fancy restaurants and banquet halls to celebrate their children turning one. At a recent outdoor bash for a four-year-old, the parents transformed their backyard into an amusement park, complete with rides, a bouncy castle, a cotton candy machine, and a popcorn maker. Even the modest three-year-old parties we attended last year at local kiddie gyms and activity centers cost the parents well over $500 for a mere two hours of entertainment.", "If a big, activity-packed\u00a0party just isn\u2019t in your budget,\u00a0worry not. You can still throw a fun, fabulous bash without spending a fortune.", "Many parents choose to rent spaces rather than host birthday parties in their homes. When you rent a space that includes an activity, you don\u2019t have to worry about setup, cleanup, or providing entertainment for your guests. However, you do pay considerably more money for the privilege of throwing your party at an outside facility.", "If your home is on the small side, or if its layout isn\u2019t conducive to hosting a large number of children, you may feel compelled to rent a space. Commonly used\u00a0rental spaces that provide entertainment for birthday parties include the following:", "Some rental spaces don\u2019t provide entertainment to those who use them for birthday parties:", "If space allows, one of the best ways to save money on your child\u2019s birthday party is to host it at your home or in your backyard. By doing so, you can save anywhere from $100 to $300.", "Of course, the downside is that throwing an at-home party means doing more of the work yourself. You\u2019re responsible for setup, cleanup, and all of the food and entertainment. On the other hand, you\u2019re in the best position to keep your costs to a minimum while stretching your dollars to focus on the aspects of your child\u2019s party that are most important to you.", "If the idea of having to clean up after a dozen or more kids is enough to make you dizzy, keep in mind that you could look into low-cost maid\u00a0services and book a one-time cleanup. Some maid services offer new customer specials, and if you keep an eye out for deals, you could book a cleaning for as little as $40 or $50, which is still considerably cheaper than renting an outside space.", "Total cost of using your home: $0 ($50 to $100 if you use a cleaning service)", "", "If the space you rent doesn\u2019t include an activity or entertainment, you need to come up with something for your guests to do other than sit around and eat. It\u2019s common for parents to\u00a0hire actors to dress as their children\u2019s favorite TV, movie, or storybook characters. The characters can perform skits, lead dances, or simply interact with the guests.", "The cost involved varies depending on where you live and how many performers you hire. A friend of mine paid $150 per hour for three performers\u00a0to dress up as characters from the movie \u201cFrozen,\u201d sing songs, and act out scenes. Other popular options for entertainment include clowns and magicians. These performers charge anywhere from $80 to more than $250 for a birthday party appearance.", "You can save a fair amount of money by providing your own entertainment.\u00a0If you\u2019re hosting a spring, summertime, or fall party, take advantage of the weather by organizing a number of outdoor activities for your guests. You can organize a series of fun relay races, set up games like ring toss and\u00a0tug-of-war, or tell your guests to bring swimsuits and let them have a water balloon fight. You could even divide your guests into teams and have a mini-camp color war-style sports tournament. Best of all, you can probably raid your basement or garage, or borrow some games from friends and neighbors, so that you\u2019re spending practically nothing to keep your guests occupied.", "A friend of mine held\u00a0an outdoor sports tournament in her backyard to celebrate her son\u2019s seventh birthday. She spent less than $20 on equipment and prizes and paid\u00a0two local teenagers $20 each to assist with the games so that she could focus on other aspects of the party, like setting up the food.", "If the weather isn\u2019t on your side and you need to keep the party indoors, you\u2019ve still got plenty of options for keeping your guests entertained:", "Of course, if you happen to have a family member or close friend who moonlights as a magician or entertainer, don\u2019t be shy about calling in a favor. A friend of mine had her brother\u2019s band perform at her son\u2019s last birthday party, and though they usually stick to heavy metal, they were happy to add some kid-friendly tunes to their repertoire for the occasion. Another friend had her teenage son borrow a costume and play the part of Spongebob Squarepants at her four-year-old\u2019s last bash.", "Total cost of entertainment: $10 to $50", "", "Hosting a party at home or in your backyard can cost just as much as throwing one outside your home, especially if you wind up spending a lot on catered food and dessert. Common food costs associated with at-home parties include the following:", "One good way to save money on food is to avoid serving a meal.\u00a0Between food allergies and general child pickiness, feeding a room full of kids\u00a0is a challenging prospect no matter what, so instead of\u00a0serving a meal,\u00a0throw a party from 2:00 to 4:00 or from 2:30 to 4:30\u00a0in the afternoon so there\u2019s no expectation of lunch or dinner.", "If you opt to serve a meal, the best way to keep your costs down is to prepare it yourself. Homemade macaroni and cheese is an easy kid-friendly meal to make in bulk, costing between $10 and $15 to make a batch that\u2019s large enough for 12 or more. If you\u2019re having adults stay for the party and want to feed them as well, whip up something simple like baked ziti, which also costs about $10 to $15 in ingredients for a large pan.", "If you really don\u2019t have the time or energy to cook, do some research to find the cheapest pizza store and spring for delivery. Most kids only need a single slice of pizza for a meal, especially if you\u2019re serving cake and other goodies. Restaurant coupons can help you keep your costs even lower.", "Another great way to save money on food is to bake your own cake. All you need are a couple of boxes of store-bought cake mix and a few cans of frosting. The best part? You can pull it off for $10 to $15, which is just a fraction of what a bakery would charge. Add in another $20 for party staples\u00a0like chips, cookies, and pretzels, plus $10 for juice and soft drinks, and your guests can be treated to more than their fair share of snacks and sugar.", "Total cost of food: $40 to $80", "", "Hosting a birthday party at home can also mean spending money on equipment. Popular rental items include the following:", "You can save money on equipment rentals by being creative and having a backup plan. For example, if you\u2019re looking to host an outdoor party and are afraid of rain, you can save money on a tent rental by being flexible and moving the party indoors in the event of inclement weather. Similarly, you don\u2019t need a bouncy castle if it\u2019s not in your budget. Instead, find some friends who own trampolines and ask to borrow their equipment for the day.", "Finally, you can skip the carnival-style concessions in favor of standard party snacks. Remember, if you rent food makers, you must also hire or ask people to man those stations. A popcorn machine may be fun to look at, but if you stick a few bags of popcorn in the microwave and serve it up hot and fresh, your guests should be just as happy.", "Total cost of equipment rentals: $0", "", "Party bags run the gamut from small bags of candy, to large, overstuffed bags filled with personalized mementos and toys. As such, the cost varies tremendously. One of my friends spent about $5 a pop for her daughter\u2019s birthday party bags, which included a few candy items, bubbles, and stickers. Another friend recently threw a magic-themed party for her son and gave out bags loaded with small toys and props, including customized trick playing cards. She spent almost $20 per bag, and later admitted that she may have gone overboard.", "It is common practice to send each guest home with a party bag \u2013 but from a financial standpoint, you\u2019re probably wasting your money. Unless you\u2019re willing to spend $10 or more per party bag, your choices are limited to cheap toys and candy \u2013 things that many parents don\u2019t want lying around the house.", "By skipping the goody bags, you can save a good $5 to $10 per guest \u2013 but forgoing the treats doesn\u2019t mean you have to send your guests home empty-handed. If your entertainment involves a craft, your guests can take home their creations to display or show off to their parents. If your guests are younger, you can let each one take home a balloon.", "Total cost of party bags: $0", "", "If you throw your child\u2019s birthday party at a kiddie gym, studio, aquarium, or zoo, decorations may either be included or not necessary. However, if you\u2019re renting out space at a pizza parlor or recreation center, you could find yourself staring at blank white walls if you choose to forgo decorations. Similarly, you may feel compelled to go big on decorations if you opt to host a party at home.", "Decorations run the gamut from simple balloons and streamers to custom-printed banners and signs. Here are some popular options:", "Decorations are nice, but ultimately, your guests are going to appreciate cake and entertainment more than some interesting decorations. It\u2019s okay to keep things simple by sticking to basics like streamers and latex balloons, and avoid customized decorations, which can be a huge budget-buster. You can also skip the\u00a0character-themed tableware and instead buy basic plastic cups, napkins, plates, and utensils for $20 or less.", "If your children are old enough, you can put them to work by having them help with the setup. They might enjoy it, and it can help get them into the party spirit.", "Total cost of decorations: $40 or less", "", "Mailing out invitations to all of your attendees can get expensive. First, there\u2019s the cost of the invitations themselves. Invitations typically come in packs of 8 to 24, including envelopes, and cost anywhere from $4 to $10. And some parents like to use custom invitations, which can cost three to four times as much.", "In addition to the invitations, there\u2019s the cost of postage. As of August 2015, the current postage rate is $0.49. If you\u2019re sending out 20 invites, that\u2019s another $10 just to get the word out.", "One of the easiest ways to cut your party-related expenses is to skip the paper invites entirely. Thanks to sites like Evite, you can create your own free electronic invite and save yourself the hassle of addressing envelopes. As an added benefit, the site allows you to constantly check your guest list and send reminders to those who have yet to RSVP.", "If you\u2019re really set on giving out\u00a0physical invitations, sites like Greetings Island\u00a0let you create your own printable invites for free. Doing so is cheaper than buying invitations, and if the majority of your guests live close by, you can save money on postage by handing out your invites instead of sending\u00a0them in the mail.", "Total cost of invitations: $0", "", "While a low-cost birthday party likely requires more time, effort, and legwork than a party where you\u2019re paying someone else to take care of the details, the savings can be pretty significant. If you\u2019re torn between a modest at-home bash versus a pricier party at a local recreation center, consider what you might do with the amount you save by hosting at home. While many people would rather put that money toward a family trip or into a college savings account, others think the memory of a big-time celebration warrants the extra money. Ultimately it\u2019s a trade-off, but any party you throw \u2013 no matter the size or expense \u2013 is one your child is sure to appreciate for years to come.", "What additional ways can you suggest to save money on a child\u2019s birthday party?window.googletag = window.googletag || {cmd: []};\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/1035677/MoneyCrashers_', [[300, 139], [300, 360], [630, 139], [630, 475], [630, 250], [1, 1], [300, 250], [300, 475], [630, 360]], 'div-gpt-ad-1590780665633-0').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.pubads().setTargeting('subcat', []).setTargeting('category', ['savings']);\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n});", "See why 218,388 people subscribe to our newsletter.", "", "The content on MoneyCrashers.com is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as professional financial advice.

(Yes, months!) He is turning four years old today, and has helped me pick out his party theme and all the party supplies. Much like his mama, this kid LOVES parties! He\u2019s still pretty young though so he doesn\u2019t quite understand what is going on, or why school is closed, or why he can\u2019t go to the park with his friends. He was pretty disappointed that his birthday party had to be cancelled, too. But I told him that we were still going to have a party - it was just going to look a little different from the party we had originally planned!

I know it might seem like an easy detail to skip over, but getting the party supplies - the plates, the cups, the napkins - will help it feel like a party! You\u2019re wanting to create something that is different from your every day. What better way to make this day feel special than with cute and fun party supplies?!

Don\u2019t skip the dessert - after all, a party without cake is just a meeting, right?! (Gotta love Julia Childs!) Involve your kids in the process of making their cake, or consider purchasing from a local bakery, grocery store, or restaurant - most are still up and running during this time and could really use your support.", "3: Don\u2019t Forget The Balloons", "Balloons are like my secret weapon when it comes to party planning. They\u2019re inexpensive, yet very impactful! Balloons can provide a huge infusion of color and create a playful, fun party atmosphere. Consider getting a bag of multi colored balloons, or balloons in a certain color scheme, to fill (with air!) to fill a room with balloons! We always like waking up our kids by showering them with balloons - such a fun way to begin the day. Plus, balloons filled with air will last for days (and days and days! I\u2019m talking weeks, y\u2019all!) So you\u2019re also creating entertainment possibilities that will last you beyond the birthday party.", "Also, consider reaching out to your local balloon vendors and party shops because many all across the USA are doing special balloon deliveries that are contact-less and adhering to social distancing! (If you\u2019re in the Mandeville, Covington, Madisonville area of South Louisiana, I\u2019d be happy to help with balloon services!)", "4: Create A Fun Activity", "Kids love to do activities!

While my son won\u2019t be aware of Canadian birthday party traditions this young, my wife and I sure are. We\u2019ve noticed many kids birthday parties are characterized by organized chaos and a heavy dose of capitalist consumption. Sometimes getting the newest hot wheels doll or Pok\u00e9mon doll can seem to be more of the raison-d\u2019etre of children\u2019s birthday parties than actually celebrating the child\u2019s special day with family (and friends). With this in mind, I took a quick world tour to see how other countries and peoples celebrate birthdays. Here\u2019s what I learned:", "A German tradition I found and liked combines unique decorations \u2013 including special candles ringing a special wooden wreath (go reusability!) \u2013 with taking a break. During their special day, children are exempt from homework and chores. Sounds like a great gift to me! I like this tradition because, rather than centering the occasion on things like toys and gifts, the birthday is made special through experience. Instead of chores, kids can do a special outing with their family or friends.", "The usual ceremony in a Western birthday is the cake and candles combined with opening a gaggle of presents. In China, when a child turns one, parents have a ceremony where they tell the baby\u2019s fortune by surrounding them with objects (ie. coins, dolls, books, etc) and watching which thing they choose. Each object connects to a career choice. While this might be a little too prescriptive for some families, choosing an object could be broadened to point towards interest or passions that can be nourished. It\u2019s also fun because it incorporates in a ritual element with deeper meaning that all too often is missing in modern consumption fests.", "Nothing builds excitement (and bedlam) like a crazy birthday party complete with balloons, cake, a dozen screaming kids and perhaps even an (evil?) clown. But in Ghana, the birthday party isn\u2019t the focus of the day. Instead, children apparently wake up to a special treat called an \u201coto\u201d that\u2019s made from sweet potato and eggs. The lesson we can draw from this \u2013 build the expectation around a (morning) meal or special treat to begin the day. You may even want to build it around a trip to a special place that the child loves.", "Most birthday parties are about receiving (presents, cake, accolades for being a year older). But what if you incorporated giving into the birthday party? In India, on their birthday, the child wears colourful clothing to school and passes out chocolate to his or her classmates. Now how cool is that? Instead of making a birthday a focus of consumption, it\u2019s flipped on its head and becomes an event marked by generosity.

It's nothing that's not reciprocated when your own child has a party\u2014but still, it can add up fast.", "And the inherent problem is, your kid probably doesn't need more things, or maybe what they really want is something that\u2019s too expensive to ask any one person to gift. That\u2019s where the concept of fiver parties comes in. Fiver parties are a growing trend in the kids\u2019 birthday party circuit, and they're catching on fast. Here\u2019s what you need to know before you attend one\u2014or decide to host one.", "In a nutshell, fiver parties are kids birthday parties where parents ask guests to bring $5 instead of a gift. The idea behind it is simple: With a fiver party, the birthday kid can pool their money or save up for a larger gift they really want. And, as an added perk, parents of guests usually end up saving money in the process, given that most toys cost way more than $5. It's a win-win situation.", "Great question. The answer is hard to pin down, but one of the first people to publicly talk about them was blogger Sarah Schultz, who first wrote in 2017 about the fiver party she threw for her son. There\u2019s also something called a two toonies party in Canada, where the birthday child is given two $2 coins\u2014one to keep and one to donate to a charity of their choice. It\u2019s possible fiver parties were inspired by two toonies parties, or vice versa. But again, it\u2019s tough to say.", "Boutique owner Joanna Jozwik Serra threw a joint fiver party for her 5- and 6-year-olds, and says it was an easy choice. \u201cThe kids have too much stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wanted to do the fiver party to purchase the kids a yearly Legoland membership.\u201d", "Serra says she explained to her children in advance that instead of getting toys they'll likely play with and forget about, the membership would be something that they could use all year. \u201cWe took a visit there to let them experience it in advance, and they loved it,\u201d she says.", "Given that this concept is pretty new, there\u2019s no set way to ask guests to bring $5 instead of a gift. Serra says she kept the wording on the invitation fun: \u201cIn lieu of gifts this birthday year, a fiver bill is all the kids need! Saving for a Legoland membership, this is all they would need for their trip on the Legoship!\u201d You could also be even more straightforward and say something like, \u201cInstead of a gift, please bring $5 for the birthday boy/girl to save toward [insert what they\u2019re saving for here].\u201d Specifically calling out what the money will go toward can make it feel less like you\u2019re just asking for cash and create more of a team vibe.", "They really aren\u2019t all that different at all, except that your child doesn\u2019t end up with a pile of gifts. Otherwise, parents usually serve the same food, play the same games, and do the usual birthday party stuff. Overall, Serra says that their fiver party \u201cwent great. We had enough for the membership and the rest went into their piggy banks.\u201d", "There are a few perks to this, according to psychologists. Getting a heap of gifts at a birthday party \u201ccan decrease the special feeling of receiving gifts if a child\u2019s play space feels saturated with toys,\u201d says Natalie L. Moser, Ph.D., director of the Michigan State University Psychological Clinic and Gerson Family Mental Health Initiative\u2014and fiver parties take that off the table. Hosting a fiver party also has the potential to teach kids that birthdays aren\u2019t all about unwrapping presents and receiving gifts, she says. But, since they\u2019re getting money, it can also teach kids about saving and using money in a responsible way.", "\u201cI really like this idea developmentally,\u201d says licensed clinical psychologist John Mayer, Ph.D., author of Family Fit: Find Your Balance in Life. Hosting a fiver party teaches kids about delayed gratification and cooperation, given that all of their guests are involved in contributing toward one gift, he says. It can also help teach skills like social communication and team building, Mayer says.", "It depends on who you talk to. Some people online have called the idea tacky, but the overwhelming majority seem on-board with it (especially the parents who tend to shell out way more than $5 per gift). It\u2019s also possible that some parents of guests would rather give a special, handpicked gift over money, and they or their children may feel disappointed that they don\u2019t get that opportunity, Moser says.", "Another thorn: In cases where you specify what you want guests to gift your child\u2014whether it's five dollars, nothing, or a charitable donation\u2014some people feel uncomfortable showing up without a gift, and they'll go the traditional route anyway. \u201cSome parents \u2018follow the rules\u2019 and others don\u2019t, which is difficult to control and difficult to explain to children,\u201d Moser says. \u201cIn general, I think that placing these sorts of gift restrictions can increase awkwardness among families.\u201d", "Still, the concept seems to work out for plenty of people. Serra says her children\u2019s guests \u201cseemed fine with it,\u201d although some still brought a small gift along with their $5. \u201cWe would absolutely do it again,\u201d Serra says."]], "https://www.parentsandkids.com/2018/06/04/brainstorming-new-birthday-party-themes/": [{"h1": ["Brainstorming New Birthday Party Themes"], "h2": ["Featured", "Strong Bones and Muscles for Healthy Kids", "Featured", "Shine the Light on Mental Health", "Featured", "Be the Light of Hope and Support", "Featured", "Dinners for Dollars", "Featured", "5 Mommy and Me Christmas Gifts for the New Mom", "Featured", "Make a Difference, Save a Child", "Featured", "It\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year...for Teachable Moments", "Featured", "When Behavior Tells a Deeper Story", "Featured", "Carols in the Park(ing) Lot", "Featured", "Shine the Light on Mental Health", "Featured", "Random Stuff That Rocks: Holiday Road Trip!", "Featured", "Random Stuff That Rocks: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", "Get In The Know", "Awesome!

Well, we happen to have a ton of birthday party ideas for boys right here, ranging across all interests and ages.

My friends were asked to simply wear their cutest, silliest or favorite hats, and that\u2019s where the theme ended. My cake was in the shape of the family dog, we bobbed for apples and our hats returned home dirty.", "Fast forward to 2018 and it seems like it\u2019s against the laws of parenthood to throw a party without a theme. The modern invite not only clarifies time and location, it also builds anticipation and asks guests to participate in a unified dress code. After all, the party ambiance is created by every guest and each decorative detail in the view of a camera lens. These photos will end up being pinned, inspiring spinoffs everywhere, and made legendary on every social media feed in your social circle.", "Let\u2019s give them something to hashtag, shall we? Here are the six birthday themes you are about to see everywhere this year:", "We first spied this trend last summer, when it was leaps and bounds ahead of its time. Spring and summer concerts are huge in Chicago, and the kids\u2019 attractions like Kidzapalooza at Lollapalooza make festival season exciting for the whole family. Music makes everyone dance, bright colors are everywhere and there\u2019s nothing better than festival foods!", "Name it: Lukapalooza, Courtchella, Ronnaroo, etc.", "Eat: Lobster corndogs and fruit on a stick.", "Wear: Bohemian dresses, fun prints, bandanas and bright neon colors.", "Decorate: Colorful balloons, stereo pi\u00f1ata, flower crowns and DIY beaded necklace or sunglass station.", "Concert theme inspo: Corri McFadden of Glitter and Bubbles\u2019 \u201cZelchella\u201d after Zelda and Coachella for a third birthday party.", "Balloons & Confetti were all over the Pinterest boards last year and show no signs of slowing down. Plus, is there anything cuter than little ones crawling or running around with oversized balloons?", "Eat: Since this is a favorite things theme, this should be on theme with your little\u2019s favorites! Mini hotdogs \u201cChicago Style\u201d are always on trend, and you can\u2019t go wrong with a taco station. A company called Packed Party makes disco ball drink containers that will be the perfect party accessory for this theme.", "Wear: When confetti is present, you dream in color, sequins and metallics. Your guests will add to the decor by wearing anything that pops and sparkles.", "Decorate: Get oversized clear balloons filled with confetti. You can DIY or find a local balloon retailer like Paris312 or Luft Balloon to do it for you. Round string lights will set the ambiance, and all things glitter and metallics are essential. The more gold and silver you can use for utensils, vases and other d\u00e9cor, the better.", "Balloon & Confetti theme inspo: Jansyn Morgan of Pony and Co Etsy shop.", "The Greatest Showman made sure circus themes aren\u2019t just for babies anymore. P.T. Barnum said, \u201cNo one ever made a difference by being like everyone else.\u201d This is a theme we can all get #trending. The crowd will go crazy for magicians, mini horses, face painters, fire breathers and/or contortionists, so pick your favorite circus acts and prepare to be amazed!", "Eat: Popcorn, cotton candy and a lemonade stand will be crowd pleasers. Grill hamburgers and hotdogs and you will be on your way to The Greatest Party.", "Wear: Black and white stripes, and red comes to mind when I think of a circus, but patrons should wear whatever they feel most comfortable in for The Greatest Show On Earth.", "Decorate: A tent isn\u2019t completely necessary, but concession stands will set the scene. A cotton candy machine, nacho stand, lemonade stand and someone passing out popcorn will make sure this act is visually astounding.", "Spring break is everyone\u2019s favorite pastime. From the time we\u2019re little, we look forward to a break from the school year and fun in the sun. Why not theme an entire party to recreate these memories? Turn up the music, warm up the kiddie pool(s), blow-up beach balls, flamingos and other fun pool floats for a party they won\u2019t soon forget.", "Eat: Spring break is all about fruity drinks and comfort food. Order Hawaiian pizzas and make refreshing strawberry smoothies for your mini Spring Breakers.", "Wear: A colorful swimsuit, cool shades and their favorite beach coverup.", "Decorate: Bright pool floats, beach towels and beach balls will make the memories last and the photos pop.", "Trends aren\u2019t fabricated by advertising companies anymore, they are started by the kids who pave their own path. Overalls and concert tees are back, and it\u2019s because these kids have said so. The big city is calling you, so pack your bags for a mini jet-setting experience. Book an Airbnb in Bucktown or grab a hotel off the Mag Mile and explore Chicago like a true jet-setter.", "Eat: Pop in a hip coffee house and fuel up for sightseeing. Hop on the Red Line or Uber (depending on group size) to Millennium Park, or Navy Pier for the ultimate city experience.", "Wear: Hipsters and trendsetters don\u2019t need to be told what to wear, and probably won\u2019t listen to what society says anyways. Here, anything this crowd wears is cool.", "Decorate: The city is your backdrop.", "Do it for the \u2018gram. Your middle schoolers are so over the kiddie scene and want to solve the world\u2019s problems over tea and macaroons. A boho-themed DIY project like making dream-catchers or flower crowns are fun, social and are even better than your Snapchat filter.Eat: Charcuterie boards, macaroons and tea sandwiches.", "Wear: Anything from whimsical dresses to bohemian tops and denim.", "Decorate: Layer rugs in the backyard, picnic style. Throw some pillows with tassels on top of the rugs for seating and use wooden boxes for tables. Cotton teepees are right on theme, and can be used as added seating, dessert tents or simply great photo ops, especially when strewn with lights. Pick some wildflowers, vase them and put them literally everywhere.

But their family does. Luckily, there are still ways to include loved ones in a social-distancing celebration.", "This idea comes from Wirecutter\u2019s editor in chief, Ben Frumin, who recently had to cancel his now-2-year-old son\u2019s planned party at Gymboree. The youngest Frumin probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed, but his 4-year-old sister\u2014as well as his aunts and uncles and grandparents\u2014sure would have. So instead of cancelling, Ben and his wife threw a virtual party, using videoconferencing software. (We also have tips for how to use this software like a pro\u2014read them before setting up the call.) All of the attendees wore their fanciest threads\u2014at the behest of the birthday boy\u2019s sister\u2014and congregated onscreen to watch him open his presents and blow out his birthday candles. Will the birthday boy remember the celebration? Who knows. But for his family, it\u2019s certainly one they\u2019ll never forget. (Making it all the more unforgettable: The Frumin children are now lobbying for Black Tie Fridays.)", "Children\u2019s birthdays usually involve large groups of friends gathering to do something active\u2014bowling, laser tag, a long afternoon eating the world\u2019s finest pizza at Chuck E. Cheese. But while we continue to practice social distancing, those activities are all off-limits. Instead, you can create community virtually.", "Take advantage of good weather by having an outdoor movie night party for your birthday kid. With just a projector, a white sheet, and some seating (we like picnic blankets for kids and camping chairs for adults with rickety backs), you have all the gear necessary to transform your yard into the coolest theater in the neighborhood. And even better, if you have enough space, you can potentially invite some friends (to sit at least 6 feet away). Just make sure to supply enough snacks for everyone in attendance.", "Even if you have the biggest backyard with the most elaborate jungle gym, for kids confined to playing there\u2014and nowhere else\u2014it will start to feel stale. To liven it up for a birthday party, one fun idea is to have the birthday kid see the space through new eyes via a scavenger hunt. A scavenger hunt won\u2019t feel festive without friendly competition; if the birthday kid has siblings, you\u2019re nearly set, but otherwise you can have the parents of their friends print out the scavenger hunt list and send video-call updates as the hunt progresses. (Good Housekeeping has collected several good lists, including nature hunts for leaves and acorns and color-based themes.) To make it more of a group effort, you can invite neighbors to join in by hiding clues in their yards as well (if they\u2019re game to let you put up a balloon, all the better). And, of course, you need to have prizes for all participants\u2014cupcakes are a given, but candy to go never hurts.", "If you\u2019d originally planned to have a clown or magician perform at your kid\u2019s birthday party, you needn\u2019t necessarily call it off. Many party performers are now offering their shows remotely, using video to beam performances straight into your living room. If you already had someone in mind, ask whether you can hire them for a remote performance instead. Or take advantage of this unmoored moment and hire outside of your area; geography doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re on a screen! (If you need a suggestion, ask your network of friends, relations, and neighbors.) I can\u2019t recommend more highly my own New York City\u2019s Looney Lenny, a clown with nearly 20 years of experience performing at children\u2019s parties. Then give all the would-be party attendees the video-call link to join in.", "You certainly can\u2019t gather a large crowd during a quarantine, but you can still do something grand to let your kid know they\u2019re special. Some people have started throwing makeshift parades (while also being sure to maintain a safe social distance of 6 feet minimum between participants). If you have a front yard, set up a chair outside for the birthday kid to sit and watch while their \u201cguests\u201d drive by, honking and shouting birthday wishes out the window. For those who live in cities that aren\u2019t as driving-friendly, the birthday kid can watch out the window as pals and family members walk and bike by on the sidewalk.", "Although it\u2019s probably safe to receive traditional cards, a video greeting is an even more interactive idea for kids than a two-dimensional piece of paper. Have loved ones record themselves wishing your child a happy birthday. You simply can\u2019t go wrong with a straightforward video made on a smartphone camera. Another fun (and equally user-friendly) option, recommended by Wirecutter deputy editor Christine Cyr Clisset, is to create a \u201ccard\u201d using the Marco Polo app. Through it, you can set up a group for families or friends to join, record and view one another\u2019s videos, and jazz up their greetings using different filters and voice effects (the robot and helium effects are crowd-pleasers among young people).", "Teens usually prefer to hang out far from the prying eyes of their parents, but that\u2019s difficult to achieve when the whole family is quarantined under one roof. The options below, however, at least give teens a few moments with their peers so they can celebrate nearly like they normally would.", "Karaoke combines all the best things in life: music, socializing, and making a fool of yourself with friends. Just because teens can\u2019t currently congregate at a normal karaoke club doesn\u2019t mean the show is over; using only two platforms, you can bring the party to their computers. First, you\u2019ll need videoconferencing software, so your child and their friends can all see and hear one another. (Headphones are recommended for this part, unless you want to spend all night listening to a bunch of teens crooning to Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran\u2014that\u2019s what the kids are listening to these days, right?) The other platform they\u2019ll need is Watch2Gether, which enables users to stream videos at the same rate (typing the song you want plus \u201ckaraoke\u201d into the search bar at the top of the page will deliver them). Even if you own a traditional karaoke machine, you\u2019ll be grateful for the two-platform computer option, which can move the show out of your own living room.", "I am not a teenager anymore, nor is it my birthday, but I just did this myself with my girlfriends from college, because slumber parties never get old. Friends can join a video call and do all their favorite things together while they\u2019re apart. For budding makeup junkies, order each party participant a bottle of nail polish and a sheet mask (or Venmo the money needed to buy them), plus the usual snacks that teenagers go for (yes, all of them), so they can partake in my favorite sport: gossip and beautifying. And no sleepover is complete without a movie; download the Netflix Party extension and your teens can watch a dumb rom-com in synch and chat about it.", "Lucky for video gamers, most multiplayer games already incorporate audio communication to make it a social experience (and we have recommendations for some of our favorite systems). But to elevate a normal game night into a special birthday celebration, snacks make all the difference. Encourage your teen and their \u201cguests\u201d to break out their favorite chips, soda pop, or celery sticks (not judging!) and\u2014ta da!\u2014now it\u2019s a party. Alternatively, if your teen is more into card games, help them host an old-school game night instead. Facebook\u2019s Instant Games offers nearly all the classics, including my all-time favorites, Uno and Cribbage. Similarly, but not Facebook-dependent, there are social games that teens can play together online via PlayingCards.io, which includes Cards Against Humanity (you\u2019ll definitely want to leave the room for that one). (For more tips as well as game ideas, we have a whole blog post devoted to hosting virtual game nights.)", "Just because adults have gotten to celebrate a lot of birthdays doesn\u2019t mean it still doesn\u2019t suck to be robbed of celebrating one now. If you have a friend or relation who\u2019s not quarantined with you, these ideas can help you make their day feel special.", "In the Before Times, I loved to tour breweries with friends and munch on cheese at wine bars, and while those options are no longer viable, some companies have shifted gears to offer such services remotely. Big Mozz, which usually provides New Yorkers with the most Instagrammable mozzarella sticks at Yankee Stadium and several food markets, is now offering its Friday-night cheese-making classes virtually. It\u2019ll send you and your loved one the grass-fed cultured cheese curd and salt directly from its vendor, and then one of its instructors will lead you through the entire mozzarella-making process on Zoom. (Full disclosure: I know one of the cheese instructors\u2014he\u2019s cute and neurotic, and you\u2019ll love learning with him or any of his colleagues.) You can all sign up for the same class and virtually learn with your birthday friend for a group celebration, or, if not, hopefully they\u2019re the sharing type and will let you snack on their finished product with them in the park later.", "Alternatively, if the birthday celebrant in your life is more of a beer person than a cheese person (or just hopelessly lactose intolerant, like me), go with a homebrewing experience. City Brew Tours, which under normal circumstances offers brewery tours across the country for people celebrating birthdays and bachelor and bachelorette parties, has pivoted to beer-making classes. Just choose between American pale ale or amber ale, and the company will ship your loved one all the tools and ingredients necessary (besides a stockpot\u2014that\u2019s on you) along with a three-hour virtual class to get you making your own beer. Again, it\u2019s more fun if you can all take the class together, but if not, in two and a half weeks when the 2.5 gallons of beer is done fermenting, you\u2019ll have all the libation necessary for another celebration.", "As reported by The New York Times (Wirecutter\u2019s parent company), many comedy clubs have pivoted to video since closing their doors. National Lampoon is now live-streaming shows free every night from its YouTube channel (you can watch together using the two-platform combo of videoconferencing software and Watch2Gether), and New York\u2019s Caveat is doing the same.

You could also surprise them with a cake delivered straight to their doorstep (or a slice of pie, if that\u2019s their preferred sweet treat). Conveniently, this is the one time a surprise delivery can\u2019t go wrong, since the birthday person will most certainly be at home to receive the package. Remember to call a restaurant or bakery first to see if it handles its own delivery (since most app delivery platforms take a cut of the purchase); if not, Uber Eats, GrubHub, and Seamless are also still operating.", "When you\u2019re on a video chat with 20 people, don\u2019t expect to have an actual conversation beyond a repeated \u201cWhat?\u201d and \u201cOh, sorry, go ahead.\u201d And these days, since many adults are juggling newly remote jobs, childcare, and the usual demands of daily life, they might not have time for the traditional get-together for birthday cocktails. But gathering everyone onto one call for the 30 seconds it takes to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d is a manageable time commitment, and it\u2019s still meaningful.", "Clowns and magicians aren\u2019t the only party entertainers pivoting to video: Tarot card readers are following suit. I don\u2019t normally believe in paranormal stuff, but on birthdays I think it\u2019s fun to hear someone else\u2019s vision of my future (as long as it involves a beach house and many adoring fans).

It doesn\u2019t even take that much thought, a lot of the time. What really has value, what takes real sacrifice, is TIME. Nothing will tell your child that you love and value them more than giving them your time.", "Therefore, simply spending the day with family is, in my opinion, just the right thing to do.
