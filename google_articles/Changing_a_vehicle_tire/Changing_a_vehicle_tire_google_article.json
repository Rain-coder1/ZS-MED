The maximum lifting height also plays a role here. It describes the distance from the ground when the jack is fully extended. Why is this so important for tyre changing? If you use a jack lifting height that is too low for your car, it might not be enough to jack the car up. The result: The tyres cannot be removed. You can find the correct lifting height for your car in the vehicle manual before you buy a car jack.", "Another important tool to have when changing tyres is the cross wrench (also known as a 4-way wheel brace). Use the cross wrench to loosen the wheel nuts and to tighten them up again after changing the tyres.

For example, if your car has a direct Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). In this case, sensitive sensors are built into your tyres which measure the actual air pressure and transmit the values directly to the control unit. If the air pressure is too low, the system will tell you that the pressure needs adjusting. If you have a direct TPMS on board, then you should only have your tyres changed by a professional.

When jacking up your car, start by finding the jack point. Most cars have several points along the body that you can use.

You\u2019ll notice that the shaft of the spike is equipped with a helical flute, somewhat like a drill bit. This is designed to clear any debris that may be left in the tread of the tyre that would stop the plug from getting an air tight seal.", "Run the spike through the puncture in the tyre using a clockwise twisting motion. This\u2019ll allow the flutes on the spike to clear the debris. You\u2019ll feel the spike working its way through the tyres internal steel reinforcing as you push it through the tyre. Continue twisting in a clockwise direction as you withdraw the spike.", "At this point you\u2019ll need to take one of the plugs and thread it into the split of\u00a0the needle tool. Place it so the plug is in the middle of the eye of the needle. Push the needle into the prepared hole in the tyre until it bottoms out. With your other hand, hold the needle\u2019s collar firmly against the tyre and withdraw the needle from the tyre. This will leave the half of the plug embedding in the tyre tread. You can trim the excess plug to almost flush with the tyre\u2019s surface to finish up. If one plug isn\u2019t enough to stop the air from escaping, you can add multiple plugs to the same hole without issue.", "This however, is only a temporary repair and the tyre should be professionally repaired at the first opportunity. To give you an idea of the durability of a plug repair, I know of a truck tyre that was repaired using a temporary plug, keeping in mind, truck tyres usually have inflation pressures in excess of 100 PSI and deal with much greater loads than any passenger car tyre. This \u201ctemporary repair\u201d then went back into daily use and was still retaining air when the truck was sold in excess of two years later. Of course we don\u2019t condone this usage, but it does go some way to explaining the potential durability of a plug repair.", "Once the repair is complete, you\u2019ll be able to use the air compressor and a tyre pressure gauge to inflate the tyre to the proper pressure and be on your way.", "Next time you head down to your favourite auto supermarket, grab a packet of metal valve caps. If the Schrader valve comes loose, the air will leak straight past the seal of most plastic caps, the metal caps however have a gasket that\u2019ll retain the air in the tyre even if your Schrader valve is a little loose, preventing you from the whole deflating experience\u2026.", "", "\u2026Is worth a pound of cure, in this case make sure that the tyre pressures are checked at least once every two weeks and keep an eye on tread wear. Tyre rotation at regular intervals will even out the tread wear amongst all of the vehicle\u2019s tyres. Tyres with less wear will be more puncture resistant. While tyres are roadworthy down to one and a half millimetres of tread depth, their puncture resistance and water shedding ability at this little treat depth is greatly compromised.

Before the spare tire can be fitted to the car the old rim and flat tire needs to be removed. Before this is accomplished, the lug nuts must be loosened and this is done with the lug wrench. A lug wrench is essentially a large socket wrench with one socket that matches the size of the lug nuts on your wheels. The length of the handle adds mechanical advantage -- the longer the handle, the more force you can exert on the nut. The pry bar on the other end is used to remove the hub cap and sometimes to pry the rim off the wheel hub if it's stuck on with rust or dirt.", "Finally, there's the spare tire. Spares are either full-size or temporary (often called \"donut\" or \"space saver\") spares. A full-size spare offers more advantages as far as safety is concerned, but it's difficult to store, especially in smaller cars. It also weighs more and is harder to manage onto the wheel hub at ground level. A donut spare is easier to store and easier to manage on to the hub. However, it's generally less safe, usually limiting driving speed to less than 50 miles per hour (80.5 kilometers per hour) and a range of less than 60 miles (96.6 kilometers). Good car maintenance means checking the air pressure in the spare tire on a regular basis, too. It only takes a couple of minutes but may save you hours of aggravation someday.", "The additional items listed are needed by certain cars rather than all cars. Wheel locks are a specially keyed lug nut socket designed to keep thieves from stealing your wheels.

If your car has wheel locks, tape the socket to the jack or to the inside of your glove box so it won't be lost.", "Some car models store the spare under the car. The spare is lowered to the ground by turning a post that lowers the spare on a wire. This post is turned with an extension bar that's also used to help drag the spare out from under the car. This part of the car is often neglected during routine automotive maintenance. Every so often, and before long trips, make sure the spare will lower and the action on the mechanism is not rusted or corroded.", "Many European cars use wheel bolts rather than wheel studs. Wheel studs stay on the hub and serve as a mounting surface for the spare. Wheel bolts screw into the hub and come off with the tire. With this type of system, putting the tire back on the car means having to manage the tire with a bolt through a rim hole and being able to wrestle the whole thing into position to screw the bolt in. This system is difficult to deal with even in controlled conditions, let alone on the side of a busy road.

If your vehicle has alloy wheels, the spare may be mounted on an alloy wheel or a steel wheel, and different lug nuts may be required.", "The temporary spare or compact spare, sometimes referred to as a \u201cdonut,\u201d is narrower than the tires mounted on your vehicle and may be of a smaller diameter. As its designation suggests, it is for temporary use only, for a limited distance and maximum speed.", "Vehicles equipped with run-flat tires are usually not shipped with a spare tire, and may not even include a space for one. Instead, run-flat tires are built with extra-strong sidewall materials. If a run-flat tire goes flat, you can still drive it but, like temporary spare tires, for a limited distance and speed.", "While you can use a full-size spare under all the same conditions, speeds, and distances of the regular tires, use caution when driving with a temporary spare or run-flat tire. The temporary spare and run-flat tire are only meant to be used for a limited distance and speed. Exceed that distance or speed and you could ruin the tire, your car, or lose traction and get into an accident. Replace a temporary spare or run-flat tire as soon as possible.", "Once you discover you have a flat tire, you\u2019ll have to replace it with the spare tire.

And, really, it depends on the situation. Here are some variables that will help identify if you can replace just one tire or two tires or if you need a set of four.", "First, let\u2019s look at why replacing a tire on your vehicle might be necessary in the first place.", "In many cases, the culprit is your tire tread depth. Generally, the tread on new tires ranges from 10/32 of an inch to 11/32 of an inch. The Virginia State Police deem tires unsafe when the tread depth reaches 2/32\u201d, and the vehicle will not pass a Virginia state safety inspection.", "However, Virginia Tire & Auto recommends replacing your tires when they get to 4/32\u201d or lower. It\u2019s a question of safety.", "Once tread wears down to below 4/32\u201d, traction, especially in wet conditions, becomes a problem. The lower the tread, the higher the risk of hydroplaning.", "Plus, with lower tread depth, your car may not be able to stop fast enough to prevent a serious accident. A couple seconds of stopping time can be the difference between stopping short or not in time.", "Read: How Tire Tread Depth Affects Stopping Distance", "If you can\u2019t remember the last time you had your tires rotated, you may be burning through your front tires\u2014yet another reason why you might need to replace a tire. Front tires tend to wear out faster than back tires because they\u2019re carrying the weight of the engine and they steer the car, which adds additional friction.", "There\u2019s always the possibility of a tire pressure leak, which would cause the tire to be under-inflated, or a tire blowout. Vehicles built since 2007 have Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors that will alert you if your tire pressure is low on your dashboard. However, it is always best practice to visually inspect each tire before any trip. If the leaky tire cannot be patched, you\u2019ll have to spring for a new tire.", "An over-inflated tire can also cause tire damage. Over-inflating a tire decreases the amount of contact the tire has with the road, making it more susceptible to damage when hitting a pothole.", "Even if the tire tread hasn\u2019t worn down, it doesn\u2019t mean your tires are safe on the road. As tires age, they deteriorate, and, over time, they can become safety hazards. This is why, according to automakers and tire manufacturers, you should replace tires every five to 10 years.", "Read: How Long Should Tires Last? 6 Factors to Consider", "So, can you replace just one tire on your car? The answer is: it depends. Here\u2019s what you should keep in mind:", "To replace just one or two tires without adversely affecting performance and safety, the other tires need to have an adequate amount of tread left. If your tires are pretty new, you may be able to get away with just replacing one or two tires.", "If your tires have worn down and there will be more than 4/32\u201d difference between the new tires and old tires, you should get all new tires.", "The tread pattern and tire type that your tires have should be similar. That is, whether they\u2019re front or rear tires, you want all your tires to be the same model and have the same or similar tread condition.", "Why? Because subtle differences in tires affect their behavior\u2014more specifically, your vehicle\u2019s ability to accelerate, brake, corner, and handle water. You want a balanced, predictable driving experience.", "If the exact tire model isn\u2019t available, go for the most similar option.

If your tires have a directional tread pattern, don\u2019t get a tire with an asymmetric or symmetric tread pattern.)", "Is your car an all-wheel drive (AWD)? If so, most vehicle manufacturers and the Tire Industry Association (TIA) recommend that you always replace all four tires at the same time.", "That\u2019s because the reduced diameter of the lower-tread tires causes them to spin faster than the new one. Wheels moving at different speeds on an AWD vehicle will put additional strain on engine components (such as the transmission and transfer case), which could result in major damage and costly repairs.", "If there\u2019s a variation of more than 2/32\u201d, you will need to replace two or four tires. Check your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual to see what the manufacturer recommends; some say to replace all four, but some say it\u2019s okay to just replace two.", "It may be hard to believe that such a small difference can make a big impact, but even slightly mismatched tires could cause damage to the drivetrain on an AWD vehicle.", "Let\u2019s Recap:", "Whatever your vehicle\u2019s make and model, the tire experts at Virginia Tire & Auto can guide you to the tires that are right for you.", "Read: How to Pick the Right Tires for Your Car", "If you decide to replace one or two tires, then you have to choose where to place them!
