But when was the last time you cleaned out your fridge? Yeah, we haven\u2019t gotten to that yet, either.", "\u201cPeople blow off cleaning appliances because they don\u2019t have the time, or it takes too long to clean the grime that\u2019s built up because they didn\u2019t have the time,\u201d says Becky Rapinchuk, a cleaning expert who goes by Clean Mama, and author of the books Simply Clean and The Organically Clean Home.", "To help get us back on track, we\u2019ve rounded up a few experts (including a microbiologist!) to remind us which germs and bacteria can build up on or in common everyday appliances (if we don\u2019t get cracking), explain how often we should be cleaning them, and tell us what to use when we do.", "Philip Tierno Jr., Ph.D, clinical professor of microbiology and pathology at NYU School of Medicine, says germs, most often mold fungi and some harmless \u201cenvironmental bugs\u201d tend to accumulate along the seal of a dishwasher. To stave them off, wipe the seal down weekly with a mild bleach solution (1-part bleach, 9-parts water). Melissa Maker, host of the YouTube channel \u201cClean My Space,\u201d says the outside of your dishwasher should be wiped down on the outside each time you wipe down the cabinets \u2014 once a week. As far as the inside goes: \u201cReplace the filter and put a cup of baking soda on the top rack of the dishwasher and leave it overnight, this will absorb any odors. The next morning put about a cup of vinegar into the bottom of the dishwasher and run it on the hottest cycle,\u201d she says.", "Studies have shown that fecal germs, like E. coli and other intestinal bacteria, and some viruses (including the rotavirus, noroviruses and hepatitis A) can survive in washing machines especially if a bleach or germicide is not used with the wash, says Tierno. To keep such unsavory bacteria at bay, he recommends running an empty cycle with just water and a cup of bleach weekly, or bi-weekly, depending on how often you use the machine. Newer washing machines have a germicidal cycle, which is also effective, says Tierno.", "Generally, dryers provide high heat but may not get hot enough to kill germs that cling to your clothes, warns Tierno. The cleaner the washer, the less bacteria you\u2019ll transmit to your dryer. Some newer dryers have a germicidal cycle, which is well worth running weekly to keep them clean.", "\u201cThese devices can harbor water-borne Legionella bacteria (as in Legionnaire\u2019s Disease), which can be present in potable water. Unlike most bacteria, they can survive in plain tap water for as long as 140 days to a year and can even survive in hot water at temperatures of 150 degrees Fahrenheit,\u201d says Tierno. To keep your humidifier clean, use a brush and soapy bleach solution to gently scrub it out once a week.", "Tierno says AC\u2019s are great at controlling particulates in air \u2014 like dust mites and fungal spores \u2014 as well as a variety of other allergens and particles. \u201cBesides cooling, the removal or reduction of allergens is the main task of an AC system. Therefore, it is imperative to change filters when they become clogged, as well as use the appropriate type filter,\u201d he recommends. Otherwise, wipe down the surface of it with an antibacterial wipe once in a while. Also, Tierno says it\u2019s super important to clean up any water that collects in or around your air conditioner before fungal mold builds up, which can really be a problem for those who are immunosuppressed or have allergies.", "\u201cStoves tend to be somewhat neglected. Splatters or spills of food that aren\u2019t promptly cleaned up can become a good medium for the growth of microbes,\u201d says Tierno. Yuck! To prevent microbes, Maker says stovetops should be cleaned after each use by wiping them down with an all-purpose cleaner and a microfiber cloth. Wipe the front of the unit down once a week. \u201cThe inside of the oven should be cleaned every 3 months, or when you notice burnt on food or smoke when you are baking,\u201d says Maker. \u201cMost ovens are self-cleaning, just make sure you remove the racks and clean those separately and follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions for best cleaning practices.\u201d", "Tierno says, in terms of germs, the biggest problem with your microwave is the door handle. Grab an antibacterial wipe and sanitize the outside every time you put food in it \u2014 the kitchen is a hotbed of cross-contamination any time you make a meal. \u201cOne must clean the oven chamber with soap and water periodically (dependent upon usage), especially if there are splashes, and also because there are many \u2018cold\u2019 spots that don\u2019t reach high temps that can kill germs,\u201d says Tierno.", "Another way to clean the inside: In her blog, Rapinchuk recommends cutting up one lemon and placing it in four cups of water in a small glass microwavable bowl. Run it until the water boils, 3-5 minutes, allowing the steam to loosen the grease, drips and grime. Use a sponge or microfiber cloth to wipe the inside clean.", "Like it or not, your fridge should be wiped down and sanitized at least once a week, for it is a hotbed of germs. Tierno says raw meats, veggies, eggs and cheeses, and cold cuts, soft cheeses, pate, coleslaw and hot dogs can harbor listeria, which actually thrives at refrigeration temps and is dangerous for elderly, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women. Plus, it is a humid space where fungal mold grows. Wipe up spills on the spot (and the handle, if appropriate) with antibacterial wipes, and give the outside a good wipe-down with whatever the manufacturer says is safe to use on the exterior.", "Before you know it, you\u2019ll have a kitchen clean enough to eat off of \u2014 as well as eat in.", "Want more tips like these?

Also, pick up some plain dish soap and baby or mineral oil.", "Get ready to clean your appliances. Dish soap is amazing in cleaning grime from stainless steel. It cleans off excess oils and simplifies the polishing process. Put just a little bit on your rag and moisten with a modest amount of water (just enough to dampen your cloth). Wipe along the grain of your appliance. For extra stubborn fingerprints, you might have to go over the area a few times. When you finish cleaning an area, dry any water streaks with a clean towel.", "Finally, it is time to polish! Dab a small amount of mineral or baby oil onto your second rag. A couple of tiny drops will suffice. Comparable to the cleaning process, follow the grain of your steel, moving in either direction. Polishing the steel this way will produce optimal results.

Carlson, CDT", "Are you one of the millions of people who wear an oral appliance? If so, please take a moment to review these tips for keeping it clean, undamaged and bacteria-free. As someone who has spent decades making these devices, I can assure you that your appliance will last longer and serve you better if you take proper care of it. This is true whether you wear full or partial dentures for replacing teeth; clear orthodontic aligners or a retainer for orthodontic treatment; a nightguard to prevent nighttime teeth grinding; or a mouthguard to protect you from injury during athletics.", "If you remember just one item from this list, remember this one. Teeth and oral appliances are made of different materials, so they must be cleaned differently. Toothpaste is actually an abrasive cleanser \u2014 it has grainy particles to help scrub bacterial biofilm (plaque) and food debris off the teeth. Because teeth are covered by enamel, the hardest substance in the human body, they can stand up to this abrasive action. Your plastic appliance, which is much softer, cannot. Toothpaste creates micro scratches in the material, which collect bacteria. This may eventually cause unpleasant odors and discoloration.", "These ordinary household soaps are much milder and do a very good job, particularly if you use one with an antibacterial agent. You only need to use a little bit on a soft brush. You could also use denture pastes and cleansers, which are non-abrasive, but they are more expensive than plain old liquid soap, which is just as good. After brushing your appliance, rinse it well.", "You will be putting soap on this brush, so you won\u2019t want to use the same brush for your teeth. However, you can use a soft toothbrush for this purpose, or a nailbrush. You can also buy a brush especially made for cleaning dentures, which is just slightly bigger than a toothbrush and has two different brush heads. They are very inexpensive, available in any drug store, and can be used to clean not just dentures but any oral appliance.", "True, boiling will kill bacteria. It will also destroy your appliance because heat distorts plastic. The reason your dentist took a mold of your mouth before having your device made was to ensure a precise fit. If you lose that fit, you lose the comfort and function your appliance should offer you. In the case of clear plastic aligners, which are fabricated to move your teeth little by little in a carefully controlled manner, you could even find your teeth moving out of alignment instead of into it. Since they are designed to be worn around the clock (except when eating), keeping them clean all the time is vital.", "Just as some are tempted to boil their appliances to freshen them up, others feel bleaching will be a good way to kill bacteria. But this, too, will break down the materials of which they are made. It will also blanch (whiten) the areas of your appliance that are colored to mimic real gum tissue. That type of artistry is exactly what you paid for. There\u2019s no point in wearing a denture that has beautifully realistic teeth\u2026 and whitish gums. Your appliance can also absorb the strong odors of bleach, which is not a substance that belongs in your mouth.", "Dentures in particular have parts that can break if dropped in a porcelain sink, and that\u2019s an expensive mishap. A towel in the sink can cushion the blow if this happens. If your hand is not quite as steady as it used to be, you can provide some insurance this way.", "Scientific studies have shown that the best way to clean an oral appliance is with an ultrasonic cleaner \u2014 a small, countertop device that costs about $45-$60 and is sold in many housewares stores. It cleans by emitting high frequency sound vibrations, which get into all the little crevices that a brush can\u2019t fit into. We call these little crevices \u201clunch boxes.\u201d You don\u2019t want to find out why!", "Keep in mind that cleaning your mouth and cleaning your appliance are two entirely different yet important tasks. If you are bothered by mouth odors, you need to consider not only the cleanliness of your appliance but also if your daily oral hygiene routine is up to par. Even if you don\u2019t have any natural teeth left, you may still need to brush your tongue and/or gum ridges, and you may want to use a mouthwash for fresh breath. Natural teeth and implant-supported teeth need to be brushed and flossed daily.", "Pets find oral appliances surprisingly appealing \u2014 especially those that have become a bit pungent from lack of cleaning. You wouldn\u2019t want your young grandchild to get a hold of it either. So when it\u2019s not in your mouth or being cleaned, the device belongs in its case, or soaking overnight in water or a cleaning solution\u2026 or safely stored according to your dentist\u2019s instructions.", "Leave them out overnight so that the natural antibacterial elements and cleansing action of saliva can do its job. And don\u2019t ignore signs of infection. If unpleasant mouth odors are a persistent problem, or you notice a white film on the appliance or on the palate (roof of the mouth) that contacts that part of your appliance, or your palate is red and looks inflamed, please consult with your dentist. These are signs of a possible oral infection, usually a consequence of prolonged denture use, which may require treatment. Again, keep in mind that your mouth and your device are two separate entities, both of which need separate and appropriate care.", "Your oral appliance serves a very important function. It also represents a significant investment in your health, appearance and well-being. Protect that investment and get the most out of it by treating your oral appliance with care and using it as directed by your dentist."]], "https://www.cookinglight.com/cooking-101/how-to-clean-stainless-steel-appliances": [{"h1": ["5 Household Items That Work Better on Stainless Steel Than Spray Cleaners"], "h2": ["Top Navigation", "Profile Menu", "Explore Cooking Light", "Profile Menu", "Cleaning Basics", "White Vinegar", "A Touch of Oil", "Dish Detergent", "Club Soda", "Baking Soda", "Share options", "Magazines & More", "Learn More", "Connect", "Other Meredith Sites", "View image"], "h3": ["Account", "Explore", "Recipes", "Holidays", "Cooking 101", "Healthy Living", "Account", "Follow us", "Struggling to cook healthy?

You won\u2019t ruin anything by wiping against the grain, but it\u2019s much less effective. Now, here's what to clean with:", "My husband complains that our house \u201csmells like salad\u201d because I prefer to clean it with white distilled vinegar and water. Stainless steel is no exception. The vinegar helps break up any residual grease left from fingertips or cooking on the surface. Put it in a spray bottle and wipe clean.", "In keeping with the salad theme, many sources suggest polishing appliances with oil\u2014whether mineral, baby, or even olive\u2014to help protect the surface. Frankly, I\u2019m less a fan of this approach, though it does work great for shine. I\u2019ve found that while it looks great at first, polishing with any of these oils seems to attract more fingerprints and smudges over time\u00a0than a simple polish with a microfiber cloth. But if showroom sheen is what you\u2019re after, oil is your ticket.", "At first, the idea of cleaning my stainless steel appliances with either dish detergent or club soda sort of scared me. Because stainless steel appliances have a tendency to show water stains, adding water seemed counterintuitive. To my surprise, a dab of non-toxic dish soap on a damp cloth removed even little-kid smudges, and a thorough drying with another cloth kept my water-panic at bay.", "Spraying the surface with club soda proved as effective as a cleaning method as dish detergent. Whether it\u2019s the tiny bubbles or the trace minerals added, club soda surprised me with how well\u2014and how easily\u2014it removed fingerprints and old spots that I\u2019d missed. It did, however, leave streaks that I had to polish...with a bit of oil.", "By far the messiest and most time consuming trick was making a paste out of baking soda and water, but\u2014hands down\u2014it did the best job. My 9-year-old fridge looked like I\u2019d just peeled off its protective plastic covering from the showroom. However, because you rub small sections of the surface with the paste and a cloth, bits of that paste might fall to the floor. Baking soda also leaves a white residue behind, which you have to remove with a damp cloth before you can polish with your microfiber cloth.", "I wouldn\u2019t use this method to clean the entirety of my appliances, but for those stubborn or hard-to-reach spots (like under the handles), baking soda is the way to go. A little paste goes a long way, and you barely need any pressure when wiping.", "As with anything, before tackling the front of your shiny appliance, test any new cleaning method on an inconspicuous spot.
