There are the daytime sessions at Pier 94, competitions in agility and obedience,\u00a0and of course, the big events at Madison Square Garden. But the background of the show is rich with little tidbits you may not know.", "Around 1876, a group of \u201csporting gentlemen\u201d would gather at the bar of the Westminster Hotel to talk about hunting and boast about their hunting dogs. One thing led to another, and the group decided it needed a real venue to compare hounds \u2014 a dog show in Manhattan. In 1877, they named themselves the Westminster Kennel Club, after their favorite bar, and hosted the First Annual New York Bench Show of Dogs. It was held at a venue, Gilmore\u2019s Garden, that would later come to be known as Madison Square Garden.", "The very first show featured more than 1,200 canine competitors, and Westminster has gained popularity since then. Along with those who attend in person, millions can watch it live on television. Currently, nearly 3,000 compete for the Westminster Best in Show title.", "So, where is everyone when they\u2019re not at the show? The most popular hotel for participants and their humans is the Hotel Pennsylvania. The hotel is more than dog-friendly; it caters to the participants with facilities that include a doggy spa with bathing tubs, an exercise area, grooming area, and a potty area. The hotel even has a full-time concierge for the show crowd.", "", "Westminster is a benched show, which means that when the dogs and their teams are not competing, they\u2019re required to stay in their assigned benching area. There, dog lovers can see the dogs and all the attendant activity. The only exception is when the dogs are being prepared for showing or being transported to and from the benching area. That\u2019s a lot of downtime for dogs and their teams, and some observers have likened hanging out in the benching area to a tailgate party.", "It can take several hours to groom some breeds for the show ring and a lot of work. For those who think their dog\u2019s bath time is a chore, imagine four-to-five hours, multiple brushes, and more hair products than most humans have. Some handlers use high-end people products that you might find in a salon on their dogs: brand name shampoos and conditioners, texturizing sprays, mousse, hairspray, rollers, flat irons, and blow dryers all contribute to show ring perfection.", "They play a vital role in a dog\u2019s success or loss. The handler has a strong bond with the dog he or she works with, which helps the dog feel confident, attentive, and comfortable in the ring. The handler is intimately familiar with the breed\u2019s proper stance, posture, and gait and can make subtle adjustments with expert leash handling and well-timed treats. All of this takes practice, practice, and more practice to work out leash handling, speed, and positioning.", "Sometimes a handler will keep them in a pocket or even in her bra. And yes, you did see a handler take a treat out his own mouth to give to the dog. It isn\u2019t as weird as it seems, because the treats are things like hot dogs, cheese, cooked chicken, or steak. The theory is that by keeping them in his mouth, the handler is focusing the dog\u2019s attention on his face, or the judge\u2019s face. An interesting anecdotal side note: many, if not most of the dogs, drink bottled water while on the road for shows to avoid any tummy upsets from local water.", "", "Actually, no. At the first show, all proceeds from one day went to establishing a shelter for disabled and stray dogs. Since then, Westminster has contributed millions of dollars to rescue, health, and training organizations, as well as to community outreach organizations. But, while there is no actual monetary prize, breeders will tell you that the offspring of champions can bring in serious money.", "They\u2019re beloved pets that share in everyday family life, much like any of our dogs do. They may live with kids or other pets, sleep in the bed, track muddy paws through the kitchen, play catch in the backyard, and generally lead the lives of well-loved, happy pets."]], "https://www.phillymag.com/news/2018/11/10/national-dog-show-thanksgiving/": [{"h1": ["How the National Dog Show Won Thanksgiving"], "h2": ["Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning \u2014 great with coffee!", "Trending", "IN THIS SECTION"], "h3": ["How the Little Poconos Town Honesdale Accidentally Got Cool", "The Mummers Are Secretly Planning a Mummers Parade", "6 ABC's Adam Joseph on His Winter Prediction and Why He Hates Coffee", "Woman Files Sexual Assault Lawsuit Against Bloomingdale's Boss", "A Pa.

While everyone else was nestled in their seats, watching the previews roll across the screen, he was pacing back and forth intensely, waiting for the phone in his hand to ring.", "The way Jon Miller remembers it now, he waited an eternity for that phone call. But in actuality, he\u2019s embarrassed to admit, it was probably only five minutes.", "Miller, 61, is the president of programming at NBC Sports. He\u2019s been on plenty of conference calls and sat in on more business meetings than he\u2019s able to count. Yet this single call 16", "years ago stands out to him with such clarity. When his phone finally rang, he answered it and was greeted by a familiar voice on the other end: Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Entertainment at the time. The conversation went a little like this:", "\u201cJon?\u201d Zucker said. \u201cDo you have any idea what your dog show did?\u201d", "Miller wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know the answer to this question. \u201cNo, Jeff, I\u2019m at the movie theater right now, and I don\u2019t have access to any of the ratings,\u201d he responded.", "\u201cWell, I do,\u201d Zucker said. The next sentence was vital. It would change everything. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the number one show on NBC this week.\u201d", "Who would have thought that a bunch of dogs gathered at the Fort Washington Expo Center \u2014 all vying for that one \u201cBest in Show\u201d title \u2014 would reach an audience of 19 million total viewers?", "That was back in 2002, the first year NBC aired what\u2019s officially known as The National Dog Show Presented by Purina on Thanksgiving Day, smack-dab up against the annual NFL extravaganza. Sixteen years later, the program is even more successful \u2014 not only reaching 28 million people, but also, and even more important, redefining one of America\u2019s favorite holidays.", "It\u2019s a hot day in August, and I\u2019m watching as principals from the National Dog Show gather in New York for a promotional photo shoot \u2014 including hosts John O\u2019Hurley and David Frei. With, of course, some dogs.", "O\u2019Hurley and Frei are behind a curtain, getting dressed, but their distinct voices seep through. It\u2019s hard to make out exactly what they\u2019re saying, but their laughter punctuates the conversation. It\u2019s clear the duo have been working together for years.", "\u201cMy father was a football coach,\u201d Frei says as he straightens his bow tie. \u201cSo I guess I always thought my career would be on turf, not a wee-wee patch.\u201d He laughs and glances around the room, his expression softening to a smile. \u201cThis is better, though.\u201d", "Frei is the National Dog Show\u2019s expert analyst and the dog-show world\u2019s most prominent face. He hosted the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, America\u2019s oldest and most prestigious show, for 27 years. O\u2019Hurley is best known for playing J. Peterman on Seinfeld. His involvement with the National Dog Show came about more serendipitously. \u201cNBC put it together in three days,\u201d O\u2019Hurley says, scratching his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know why they wanted me. But they called me on the second day and said \u2018Woof, woof,\u2019 so I came running.\u201d", "Jon Miller laughs when people ask how he came up with the idea to put a dog show on the air on Thanksgiving. It was a cold January night in 2002, he remembers, and his wife had rented the movie Best in Show from Blockbuster (you know, that store where you used to rent videos before the days of Netflix-and-chill). They were having a movie night with neighbors, along with plenty of wine.", "\u201cWhen they left,\u201d Miller says, \u201cI watched it a second time and found it hysterically funny.\u201d", "The movie \u2014 directed by Christopher Guest and released 18 years ago \u2014 is a satirical look at the dog-show world, and after watching it, Miller was inspired to find out what that world was really like behind the scenes. The drama, the competition \u2014 surely it was the canine version of Toddlers & Tiaras. Since TV rights to Westminster were already taken, Miller called up the Kennel Club of Philadelphia and asked if NBC could buy one day of its long-running (if slightly less prestigious) dog show to broadcast on the network. He was confident in his idea at that point, excited about its potential and hopeful for its success.", "But when he presented his proposal to Wayne Ferguson, now president of the Kennel Club of Philadelphia, Ferguson didn\u2019t share his enthusiasm, much to Miller\u2019s dismay. Believing NBC wanted to do something similar in tone to the satirical Best in Show, Ferguson told Miller he wasn\u2019t interested in being a part of the project at all. Sure, the club needed the TV money, but he wasn\u2019t comfortable subjecting the show to ridicule.", "Philadelphia has a long history with the purebred dog world, dating all the way back to 1876, when it first hosted an \u201cExposition of Dogs\u201d at the U.S. Centennial Exposition. \u201cEverything started in Philadelphia,\u201d says Ferguson. The KCP hosted its first dog show in 1912 and, with the exception of a few years during the Depression, has held it annually ever since. (For many years, it took place at the Civic Center; after a decade of wandering around, it moved to the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks in 2009.) \u201cPhiladelphia is passionate,\u201d says Ferguson, 77, a man who has a smile on his face and a dog at his hip in almost every photograph there is of him. \u201cThey\u2019re passionate about football, they\u2019re passionate about food, and they\u2019re definitely passionate about dogs. Our show has always been timeless, and we knew that. We just needed NBC to see that, too. We were better than the movie.\u201d", "Miller understood Ferguson\u2019s position and promised him that NBC would do it right. From there, the partnership began. However, the path to getting on the air was riddled with hurdles.", "When Miller pitched the idea to his boss, NBC Sports head Dick Ebersol, Ebersol practically threw him out of the office. The idea wasn\u2019t legitimate enough for him. A dog show didn\u2019t count as a sport.", "Eventually, though, Miller proposed the idea to Zucker, who signed off, at least in part because ratings for NBC\u2019s Thanksgiving Day broadcast of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life had been consistently low. He figured he\u2019d push George Bailey to the curb and see how viewers reacted to a dog show instead.", "While the response from Ebersol didn\u2019t exactly qualify as supportive, Miller trusted his instincts and remained determined. Sure, it\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world \u2014 pun intended \u2014 but he believed in the project. If he was willing to watch a movie about a dog show more than once \u2014 more than twice, even \u2014 there had to be some portion of that world that would tune in on Thanksgiving for something other than football or a parade. He also wanted to prove Ebersol wrong.", "\u201cBeing underestimated is one of the biggest motivators, they say. And I just thought, \u2018Damn, how great would that be,\u2019\u201d says Miller. \u201cSometimes, you just have to take a risk. And this time, we were lucky.\u201d", "While it\u2019s broadcast on Thanksgiving Day, the National Dog Show actually takes place the weekend before the holiday. Some 2,000 purebred canines, representing more than 180 breeds, descend on Oaks and compete for \u201cBest in Breed,\u201d \u201cBest in Group\u201d and \u201cBest in Show\u201d honors. They do this while a live audience of about 15,000 people watches and cheers. Last year\u2019s Best in Show winner, a Brussels Griffon named Newton, bore a strong resemblance to Chewbacca from the Star Wars franchise. One viewer speculated on Twitter that the result was arranged as part of a promotional campaign for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which hit theaters just three weeks later \u2014 a charge the show\u2019s organizers naturally dismiss.", "In fact, the judges know exactly what they\u2019re looking for. They examine the dogs, comparing them to their Platonic ideal of the perfect dog as laid out in the breed\u2019s official standard. They look at the dog\u2019s overall appearance, temperament and structure \u2014 the qualities that allow the dog to perform the function for which it was bred.", "The National Dog Show is an open, all-breed show, which means that technically, any purebred dog can enter to compete once it\u2019s registered with the American Kennel Club. The dogs are \u201cbenched\u201d during the day, allowing the public to visit them. (Philadelphia is now one of only three benched shows in America, along with Westminster and the Golden Gate Kennel Club Dog Show in the Bay Area.) While there are more than 3,000 dog shows in America each year, the National Dog Show is by far the most widely viewed \u2014 thanks to its national audience on Thanksgiving Day.", "Miller and Ferguson agree the show never would have done so well if NBC had aired it on any other day. It needed Thanksgiving to thrive. There\u2019s something about a holiday that resonates with people. We like sticking to a routine, and tuning in to the National Dog Show at noon on Thanksgiving seems to fit right in.", "Miller says people care about two things other than their children and their families: their cars and their dogs. Frankly, I have to agree. My shitty purple Scion and my white German shepherd \u2014 lovingly named after Pink Floyd \u2014 are, in fact, extremely important to me.", "The point is, the National Dog Show has changed the nature of Thanksgiving. The holiday isn\u2019t simply about stuffing our faces to excess or fighting with siblings over who gets the wishbone. It\u2019s about family. I can tell Miller is trying to avoid getting sentimental, but he loosens his collar when I ask what the holiday means to him.", "\u201cIt\u2019s family. It\u2019s about sitting around the TV or the dining room table and getting to be with them \u2014 really be with them. Yell at them, yell with them. And it\u2019s easier to do it with a dog show on. I\u2019ll deny that I said this \u2014 even though it\u2019s going in print \u2014 but a football game doesn\u2019t entertain everyone. But a dog is just fun. You cheer on the breed you like, and you snuggle up on the couch with your own dog by your side.\u201d", "Miller has me reaching for my own Thanksgiving memories. Usually, the smell of burnt butter wakes me up just in time to help mash the potatoes. The rest of the day mirrors that of most other families: We watch television, we cook, we watch television, we eat, and then we watch more television. My father controls the remote, which means football is on, even if a team he despises is playing \u2026 like the Dallas Cowboys.", "But when he does change the channel, it\u2019s to see what\u2019s happening with the dog show. And in my house, that\u2019s saying something. Because you don\u2019t get my father to turn off football unless there\u2019s something better going on.", "\u201cAt our house, it\u2019s a tradition,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWe watch the parade, we get dinner ready, we go outside and throw around the football, and we make sure we\u2019re inside by 12 o\u2019clock to watch the dog show. We don\u2019t do anything until the dog show is over. But we like it that way; we\u2019re used to it now. It\u2019s our tradition.\u201d", "Dogs really are man\u2019s best friend. Wayne Ferguson says he can\u2019t imagine having a better companion to spend his days with:\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re a part of the family. You come home and they\u2019re there to greet you with their tail wagging. They\u2019ll always love you.\u201d He speaks slowly, as if it\u2019s important to him that the words come out just right.", "\u201cI think that\u2019s why we\u2019re so eager to cheer them on during the dog show,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though it may not be our dog competing, it\u2019s sort of a way to return the favor and say \u2018I love you\u2019 back to them.\u201d", "If you\u2019re a cat person, you\u2019re going to have to figure out something else.", "Published as \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d in the November 2018 issue of Philadelphia magazine.", "The Philadelphian\u2019s Guide to Hosting a (Small!)

After all, everyone is a beginner at the start. Following the tips below, you\u2019ll soon find your bearings and get caught up in the contagious camaraderie that defines the very best of the dog show world. Once you do, remember that now it\u2019s your turn to help the next dog show newbie, just as someone did for you.", "For plenty of people, the sport of dog conformation is a family affair. Many involved are just the most recent generation of breeders, handlers, or judges in their families. If you weren\u2019t born into this sometimes insular world, however, there are lots of knowledgeable people who will help you learn the ropes, if you know where to find them.", "If you already own a purebred dog, a good place to start is the breeder from which you acquired them. If that isn\u2019t a possibility, reach out to the nationally-based parent club for your breed to inquire about membership, as well as mentoring opportunities. Alternately, look up\u00a0local all-breed kennel clubs, which are made up of fanciers across many breeds. Clubs today are often looking for volunteers and potential new members to keep younger generations involved in the sport.\u00a0Another excellent resource is the AKC Exhibitor Mentoring Program, which is designed to connect experienced handlers or breeders with newcomers to AKC sports and events.", "Dog shows themselves are also a great place to meet people and absorb knowledge, but remember that timing is everything. Approaching a handler before they enter the ring, or while they\u2019re in the middle of grooming a Poodle, is probably not ideal. If you\u2019re unsure, ask, the handler if it\u2019s a convenient time to talk. If it isn\u2019t, simply return at a time that works better for them.", "", "Sure, print catalogs are becoming somewhat anachronistic in our increasingly digitized world, but they are still sold at every conformation show. They contain the name of each dog entered, as well as their owners and breeders, and are therefore an invaluable resource in researching potential mentors, both in your breed and outside of it.", "Handling class that is. Though showing a dog looks easy, it takes some time to get the routine down. That\u2019s what training classes are for. There, an experienced instructor will teach you and your dog exactly what is expected from you in the ring, from how to \u201cstack,\u201d or pose, your dog to how to show the judge the bite, or teeth. There\u2019s a lot of jargon to learn, but your fellow handling classmates will help get you up to speed.", "", "Some breeds are \u201cwash and wear,\u201d requiring only a quick pass with a hound glove or damp cloth to get them looking their best. Others, such as terriers and most long-coated breeds, need a grooming regimen to make sure their coats are appropriately maintained. Job one is finding someone who knows how to groom your breed for the show ring. For serious conformation competitors, the average pet store groomer likely won\u2019t be much help here. Again, ask your breeder\u2019s advice, or work on cultivating a mentor who can share their hard-earned knowledge in this area.", "All dogs need to have clean teeth and well-tended nails, so training your puppy to accept tooth-brushing and nail-clipping as a regular part of his grooming routine is critical. And if your dog\u2019s breed is one that is regularly groomed or examined by the judge on a table, gradually train him to be very comfortable standing on one \u2014 always supervised, of course.", "Not all dogs are show-dog material, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. A true mentor will honestly assess your dog\u2019s virtues and faults \u2014 and, yes, every dog has both. If a career in conformation is not in the cards for your canine, consider an AKC dog sport. Obedience, Rally, Agility, Coursing, Tracking, Tricks, and Performance Sports\u00a0are all excellent activities that will enhance the bond between you and your dog. Before diving in, Canine Good Citizen training is a smart first step for teaching your dog good behavior.", "Dog shows and the people in the world of conformation are competitive \u2014 that\u2019s a fact of life. However, AKC rules make a point of emphasizing good sportsmanship, and you should strive to be gracious in victory as well as in defeat. Realistically, more people lose at a given show than they win, so don\u2019t make winning your sole objective. Instead, establish a more attainable goal for yourself. Perhaps it\u2019s engaging in a conversation where you learn one useful tip, or identifying one part of your presentation in the ring on which you can improve. Those aren\u2019t as tangible as a blue ribbon, but they can turn out to be even more valuable in the long run.", "", "In the past, most dog shows were benched, which meant all dogs were required to stay for the day, and fanciers became a captive audience, learning a lot about their breed and others, if only by osmosis. At all but a handful of today\u2019s shows, exhibitors are free to leave after their breed is judged, and most do, especially if they didn\u2019t do any winning.", "It\u2019s up to you to buck that trend. When possible, stay and watch other breeds being judged. Pay particular attention to the professional handlers. Watch how they put their hands on their dogs, where they stand in the ring, when they let their dogs rest, and when they turn them on. A lifetime of experience went into honing their conformation skills, so why not learn from watching the best?", "Amid all the first-time jitters, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that dog shows are supposed to be enjoyable. Whether they are or not entirely depends on your attitude, which in turn gets transmitted right down the lead. Chances are your dog doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019ve won or lost. All they know is they\u2019re out having a great time with their human.", "At the end of the day (while this may be a clich\u00e9, like most clich\u00e9s, this one\u2019s true), no matter who wins Best in Show, the best dog of the day is the one you take home with you."]], "https://tvline.com/2019/11/28/national-dog-show-2019-winner-bulldog-thor-photos/": [{"h1": ["National Dog Show 2019: Did This Year's New Breed Win Best in Show?"], "h2": ["TVLine", "2021 Renewal Scorecard Is Here"], "h3": ["Today's Hottest Stories"], "h4": [], "h5": ["", "", "", "", ""], "h6": []}, ["By\n\t\t\t\t\nAndy Swift / \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNovember 28 2019, 11:01 AM PST", "", "If you think turkey is top dog on Thanksgiving, allow us introduce you to some four-legged friends that would literally beg to differ.", "NBC on Thursday continued its time-honored tradition (18 years and counting!) of airing The National Dog Show, an annual event that truly reminds you how poorly behaved your own pet really is.", "This year\u2019s festivities were once again hosted by John O\u2019Hurley (Seinfeld, Family Feud) and David Frei, an American Kennel Club-licensed judge.

The competition is broadcast on Thanksgiving Day at noon; here are four reasons it\u2019s well worth a watch, even if you\u2019re (gasp) a cat person.", "The National Dog Show is always held in the Philadelphia area; it\u2019s hosted by the Kennel Club of Philadelphia and sanctioned by the American Kennel Club. The city has a long history with purebred dog shows; the first dates back to 1876 at the Centennial Exposition, and a version of the National Dog Show has been held annually since the early 1900s (with a break from 1928 to 1932, during the Great Depression).", "The National Dog Show is one of just six \u201cbenched\u201d dog shows in the US, which means participating dogs must be present at the show and accessible to the public for the entire time, unless they are competing, exercising, or being groomed. (Unbenched shows, by contrast, only require the dogs to be present when their breed or other round is being judged.) So, yes, this means that if you snag tickets to the National Dog Show (which are pretty cheap!), you can actually go backstage to meet the dogs. And as Philly.com points out, \u201c[A]s long as you ask first and they haven\u2019t just gotten their fur done, many, if not most, dogs are pettable.\u201d", "But make sure you ask before you touch, because a show dog\u2019s grooming process is often elaborate and very time-consuming. A standard poodle, for instance, could need three hours just for a shampoo and blow-dry, not to mention the traditional shave of fur into complicated geometric tufts to achieve what\u2019s known as the \u201ccontinental trim.\u201d", "(Fun fact: While that style now is purely decorative, it used to be functional, as David Ramsey explained for the National magazine. Poodles served as German water retrievers, and the poofs of hair kept their joints and organs warm in the water while the rest of their fur was shaved to help keep them afloat. Even the little puff on the tail was useful as a rudder.)", "The National Dog Show is just one of countless canine competitions in the US. One of the best known is the Westminster Dog Show, held at Madison Square Garden, which has also been around since the late 19th century and, until recently, even shared a host with the National Dog Show: David Frei, who ended his gig with Westminster after the 2016 event due to a network agreement that saw the Westminster broadcast moving to Fox Sports (previously, both shows were broadcast by NBC networks).", "The largest dog show in the world is Crufts, which is held in Birmingham, England, and is considered the pinnacle of doggy achievement. To enter, dogs must qualify by placing highly in another Kennel Club\u2013licensed show, sort of like how people who want to run the New York Marathon have to qualify in a previous race first. Most delightfully and bizarrely of all, Crufts, unlike other dog shows, features a \u201cheelwork\u201d round, which involves dogs and their costumed handlers basically performing a dance routine to music.", "The National Dog Show divides its more than 2,000 participants into seven groups: terrier, toy (Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, Shih Tzus), sporting (golden retrievers, pointers), working (boxers, Great Danes), hound, herding (English sheepdogs, Border collies), and non-sporting (everything else, including Dalmatians and French bulldogs). Each dog breed is judged individually; the winner from each breed participates in the group round, and the top dog from each group goes on to compete for the vaunted Best in Show award.", "The judges look for the following:", "Is this dog able to perform the job the breed was originally bred to do? Does this dog have all of the physical characteristics typical of their breed? How fit is the dog? Do they have the correct gait? Lastly, the judges study the expression on the dog\u2019s face and general demeanor. Judges look for happy dogs that enjoy competing in the show.", "The fascinating thing from a viewer\u2019s perspective is the sheer variety of breeds these groups encompass. You\u2019re probably familiar with several of the American Kennel Club\u2013recognized breeds that compete at the National Dog Show: your Labradors and pugs, your mastiffs and fox terriers. You may even remember an odd breed or two from previous competitions; Westminster 2013, for instance, taught America how to pronounce \u201cAffenpinscher\u201d (which means \u201cmonkey-like terrier\u201d in German) thanks to Best in Show winner Banana Joe. But it\u2019s likely that even doggie die-hards won\u2019t be familiar with every one of the 200-plus breeds recognized, and the National Dog Show adds new ones nearly every year.", "It doesn\u2019t help that several of them are very rare and sound like something out of a J.K. Rowling novel: wirehaired vizslas, Keeshonds, Portuguese Podengo Pequenos, Bouviers des Flandres. And part of the joy of watching the show is hearing Frei and John O\u2019Hurley, longtime hosts of the television broadcast, read off the various breed names with obvious glee, letting every syllable roll off their tongues as each unfamiliar-looking beast takes the arena.", "The hosts also bring their deep dog knowledge to the commentary, resulting in a mix that\u2019s both informative and irreverent. After watching the National Dog Show, you\u2019ll know not only that the weird mop-like creature on the cover of Beck\u2019s Odelay is a Komondor but also that those fur cords require less maintenance than you\u2019d expect. (Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski will also reprise their Olympics partnership for the show, interviewing competitors and providing backstage commentary.)", "This year, the dog show has approved two new breeds for competition. The Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en (the name translates, approximately, as \u201clarge, low, shaggy dog of the Vend\u00e9e\u201d) is a scenthound from France whose \u201cwhose mustache, beard, and profuse eyebrows suggest the look of a worldly but amiable Frenchman,\u201d per the American Kennel Club. And the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje (also known as the \u201cDutch decoy dog\u201d) is a red-and-white spaniel-type dog once used to lure ducks.", "Don\u2019t let the genteel air fool you: As with any competition, dog shows bring out rivalries, the potential for huge upsets, and occasional scandals. In 2015, for example, a prize-winning Irish setter named Jagger died after the Crufts show and the owners discovered poison in his stomach, leading to accusations of murder by a competitor. Perhaps unsurprisingly, mainstream news outlets from Vanity Fair to Mashable picked up the story.", "And the cutthroat competition isn\u2019t just about owners\u2019 love for their pets: Dog shows are a very expensive (and only occasionally profitable) endeavor. Buying a purebred dog can cost up to $5,000, Dr. Jerry Klein, the American Kennel Club\u2019s chief veterinary officer, told the New York Times. Then there\u2019s the price of training, grooming, and feeding, and the costs for entering and traveling to shows, along with handlers\u2019 fees. For really big shows like Westminster, some owners even shell out big for a \u201ccampaign\u201d \u2014 literally an advertising blitz touting a winning dog\u2019s success at shows and in dog magazines. As the Times reported:", "Ms. Wiest [a Labrador breeder] said she spent between $27,000 and $30,000 on a campaign for Baccara, who was the No. 1-ranked Labrador in 2014. Going into Westminster, the dog was a favorite to do well. But she didn\u2019t even win her breed.", "However, even winning Best in Show isn\u2019t exactly akin to winning the lottery: At the National Dog Show, the top prize comes with a check for around $1,500; Westminster\u2019s reward, says the Times, is merely a commemorative pewter bowl. But champion dogs can bring in money another way \u2014 as breeding stock. Puppies of major-show champs have reportedly sold for as much as $25,000, and a dog\u2019s semen alone could go for $2,000.", "Yet despite the high financial stakes, sometimes the drama simply stems from the fact that the competitors are still, well, animals. Though the dogs are highly trained, there\u2019s always a chance something will go awry \u2014 with often amusing results. Accidents happen on the show floor, and occasionally a dog has other plans for how the day should go, like at Westminster 2015, when an impatient Leonberger named Dario decided he didn\u2019t feel like waiting until after his round to snag a treat or two.", "What\u2019s in a name? For show dogs, a lot. You won\u2019t find any Fidos and Rovers on the show circuit; instead, you\u2019ll hear names like CH Roundtown Mercedes of Maryscot (a Scottish terrier who won that National Dog Show\u2019s Best in Show title in 2009) or Raydachs Playing With Fire V Gleishorbach (a fittingly long name for a long-bodied dachshund). The dogs also have nicknames, or \u201ccall names,\u201d which is how the incredible \u201cLafford Fly Me Too Farleysbane,\u201d a Papillon, becomes the more prosaic \u201cDave.\u201d", "While these monikers might seem overly complicated, even nonsensical, there is some rhyme and reason to them. The name of the kennel where the dog was born is usually included. Then there\u2019s the part of the name that\u2019s individual to the dog and can really be anything \u2014 an owner\u2019s favorite song or movie character, the name of a beloved athlete, etc. Breeders will often theme litters\u2019 names around a certain subject to help distinguish one litter from the next. And if a puppy happens to be born to prize-winning dogs, it may get a name that combines or references the names of its prestigious parents.", "Once a dog achieves certain qualifications or wins certain prizes, its name gets amended with letters designating the specific title won: CH for champion, CWSG for world show champion, and so on; these can be a prefix or a suffix depending on the designation. (The American Kennel Club has a detailed \u2014 and long \u2014 list of all the designations.) So when you\u2019re watching the dog show on Thanksgiving and GCH Kiarry's Pandora's Box appears on your screen, you can truly appreciate the thought process that brought about that particular string of words.", "The National Dog Show airs Thursday, November 22, at noon (all time zones) on NBC.

The best of each breed then competes against other breeds in their group with one chosen as the group winner; these dogs then vie for the Best in Show designation.", "Meet the new breed", "A new breed, the Azawakh,\u00a0will join the competition in 2020. The Azawakh is a sighthound, a breed that includes certain types of Greyhounds, and originates from\u00a0West Africa. (To be recognized by the American Kennel Club, a breed must be represented in number across the U.S. and have an established base of breeders and owners.) The AKC recognized two other breeds in December, the Barbet and the Dogo\u00a0Argentino, but the pair won't be eligible for the competition until 2021.", "Potential favorites", "As noted, Westminster history favors the terrier group, which features 32 breeds in competition.

One is a Whippet named Bourbon\u00a0\u2014 the Whippet breed is also a\u00a0sighthound\u00a0\u2014 who won two recent AKC-approved events in Georgia. A Havanese, In The Name Of Love, was named Best in Show at two AKC events in Fresno, California, in early February. And a Siberian Husky, Nick of Dynasty, won Best in Show last weekend at the\u00a0Great Barrington Kennel Club in Massachusetts.", "Popular dogs are also-rans", "America's favorite breeds may be cheered on by viewers at home, but rarely, if ever, make the cut for Best in Show. That includes the most popular breed in the U.S. for the past quarter-century, the Labrador Retriever, which has never been named the best of its group. (Though the breed does very well in the\u00a0Masters Obedience events.) Other name-brand breeds without a Best in Show win: the Golden Retriever, Dachshund, Chihuahua, Dalmatian,\u00a0Great Dane and French Bulldog.

The winner of \"best import\" is not allowed to compete for best in group, but is allowed a lap of honour around the main ring before group judging starts (sometimes called Best in Group). These are known as the General Specials.", "The audience at a dog show is expected to be participatory and vocal, and often applaud the silkiest, fluffiest or more popular breeds while ignorant of the breed standards. Those who are owners and breeders may cheer for a popular handler or a sympathetic favourite from a particular breeding kennel. But of course the judge is supposed to ignore all attempts to influence the decision. Finally, the winners from each group compete for 'Best in Show'.", "There are several types of show in the UK. The smallest are the Companion Shows, where there are usually a few conformation classes for pedigree dogs, and several \"novelty\" classes, such as \"waggiest tail\" and \"handsomest dog\", which are open to any dog including crossbreeds. These shows are usually held to support a charity or other good cause.", "There are Open shows, which are open only to dogs registered with the Kennel Club. There are many Open shows that are held all around the country. Here the dog and handler can gain experience and the dog can gain points towards a Junior Warrant award or a Show Certificate of Merit.", "There are also Limited shows, which are open only to members of the Society or Club running the show, and Challenge Certificate winners (see below) cannot enter.", "Finally, there are the huge Championship shows, where dogs can gain points towards a Junior Warrant and compete for the highly coveted Challenge Certificate (CC). If the breed is sufficiently numerous, the Kennel Club awards a Challenge Certificate for the Best Dog and Best Bitch. A dog needs three CCs from three different judges to be awarded the title of Champion, one of which must be awarded when the dog is over 12 months old.", "First held in 1891, the most prestigious Championship show is Crufts, and each dog entered at Crufts has to qualify by certain wins at Championship show level. The highest profile dog show in British culture, Crufts is the largest show of its kind in the world. It is held annually over four days in early March at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, England. The main competition is for the Best in Show award.", "There is no Champion Class in the United Kingdom and all Champions (including those from countries which the Kennel Club recognises) must be entered into the Open Class; exceptions are dogs or bitches which are still eligible for an age class (i.e., Puppy or Junior, as some countries allow puppies to become Champions (e.g., the USA)). This is one of the reasons that the UK title is so difficult to achieve. Not only are opportunities very limited, but youngsters have to compete against established Champions for Best Dog or Best Bitch.", "The Kennel Club also operates a separate show open only to mixed-breeds, Scruffts, which judges its contestants on character, health, and temperament with people and other dogs.", "The rules for the United Kennel Club (UKC) use a different points system than in the USA. A championship requires a combination of points and competition wins. Points are awarded at breed level for each win; for example, winning the class earns 10 points in non-variety breeds and 5 in variety breeds, even if there are no other dogs to beat in the class. Competition Wins are wins over at least one other dog, whether in their own breed (such as going Best Fe/male or Best of Winners) or higher level (placing above at least one other dog in the group or Best/Reserve Best in Multi-Breed show). A championship requires a total of 100 points and three competition wins.[3]", "There are seven classes per breed in American Kennel Club dog shows:", "The American-Bred and Open classes are mandatory for each show, while the others are optional.[4] In some cases, one or more of these classes may be divided by color, height, weight, or coat type.", "With the males going first, the judges inspect each of these classes individually, and award ribbons for first through fourth place. At this stage, first-place winners do not get any points. First-place winners from the male classes then come together to compete for Winners Dog (WD).", "Females then go through this same process of competition within classes, then the winners of each class compete for Winners Bitch (WB).", "The Reserve Winners award goes to the runners up for Winners Dog and Winners Bitch. Only Winners Dog and Winners Bitch get points toward championship. The number of points awarded varies and depends on how many dogs of its breed and sex are shown regionally. The more dogs defeated, the greater the point-reward (with five being the highest).", "Next comes the award for Best of Breed (BOB). Dogs that have earned the points necessary to be champions can enter this race with the Winners Dog and Winners Bitch. After judges award Best of Breed, they give out an award for Best of Winners (BOW) which is only between the Winners Dog and Winners Bitch. Finally, the judges determine the Best of Opposite Sex, which is for the best dog of the opposite sex of the Best of Breed.", "A dog can actually earn extra points during these awards, depending on the number of dogs of its sex and champions that were competing against it.[5] Afterward, the Best of Breed winner may advance to group showing. In a breed specialty show, the Best of Breed is also called Best in Specialty.", "In multi-breed and all-breed shows, the winners of all breeds within the kennel club's breed groups then compete for Group placements. For example, all the Terrier Group Best of Breed winners compete for Group First, Group Second, Group Third, and Group Fourth. Finally, the seven Group First winners compete for Best in Show. Beginning July 3, 2012, the final judge at all AKC all-breed shows will also award a \"Reserve Best in Show.\"", "In the American Kennel Club, a dog needs 15 points to become a Champion, with each win gaining anywhere from zero to five points depending on the number of dogs competing and the area where the show is held.[6] At least two wins must be a set of three or more points (\"majors\") under two different judges; at least one additional win under a third judge is also required.", "Canadian Kennel Club shows are nearly identical to American Kennel Club dog shows, with the exception of a \"Canadian-Bred\" class replacing the AKC's \"American-Bred\". The main difference is the number of points required for a Championship, and the way those points are calculated.", "Under the Canadian Kennel Club rules, 10 points are needed for a Championship, with wins awarded by at least three different judges, and at least one \"major\" win of two or more points. Once a Championship is completed, dogs may earn points toward their Grand Championship.", "As of January 1, 2013 to reach a Grand Championship, 20 points are needed with two \"majors\". Next is the Grand Excellent Championship which may be awarded to dogs who accumulate 100 points and have won at least one best in show. Region is not a factor in determining points for a win in Canada\u2014the point schedule is the same across the country.[7]", "In Colombia dog shows are maintained and organised by the Association Colombian Kennel Club (Asociacion Club Canino Colombiano). Their conformation shows follow the rules of the International Federation of Kennel Clubs. (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale). According to the ACCC, only purebred dogs recognised by the FCI are allowed to participate. Purebreds of Colombian origin must be registered to the ACCC and therefore they must hold an LOC number (Number in the Colombian Book of Origins).[8]", "Dog shows take place all year in various locations. Some are small, local shows, while others draw competitors from all around the country or the world. Some shows are so large that they limit entries only to dogs who have already earned their Championships. Therefore, winning Best of Breed or Best in Show can elevate a dog's, a breeder's, or a kennel's reputation to the top of the list overnight. This greatly increases the price of puppies bred from this dog or at the dog's kennel of origin.", "In the United Kingdom, the international championship show Crufts was first held in 1891. Since its centenary year in 1991, the show has officially been recognised as the world's largest and most prestigious dog show by the Guinness Book of Records, with a total of 22,991 dogs being exhibited that year.[9] 22,964 dogs were exhibited in 2008, 27 short of the previous record.[10] Crufts is held over 4 days at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Birmingham and it is the largest annual event held at the venue, with an estimated 160,000 visitors in 2008. The winner of the title of \"Best In Show\" receives a replica of the solid silver Keddall Memorial Trophy and a surprisingly small cash prize of \u00a3100.", "The largest and most prestigious dog show in America is the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which was established in 1877 and is held annually at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The 2008 show had a total entry of 2,627 dogs, making the event the second-largest continuously held sporting event in America.", "The other two major American dog shows are the National Dog Show (which is televised on Thanksgiving Day by NBC, usually after the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade) and the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship.", "The World Dog Show is sponsored by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale for international championships in conformation and other dog sports. The location rotates between member countries.[11] The 2008 show was held in Stockholm, Sweden, the 2009 in Bratislava, Slovakia and the 2010 show in Herning, Denmark.[12]", "The practice of breeding dogs for conformation showing has become a subject of intense debate. Some critics state that conformation shows lead to selecting of breeding dogs based solely upon appearance, which is seen by some as being detrimental to working qualities and at worst as promotion of eugenics.[13]", "In the United States some working dog breed organisations, such as the American Border Collie Association and the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, have put a considerable amount of effort in the fight to keep their breeds from being recognised by the AKC and some other kennel clubs,[14] as they fear that introduction of their breeds to the show ring will lead to decreasing numbers of working dogs with adequate qualities.", "In August 2008, BBC1 televised a documentary film titled Pedigree Dogs Exposed, which investigated the subject of health issues affecting pedigree dogs in the United Kingdom, with a particular emphasis on dogs bred for showing. The programme provoked an unprecedented response from both the public and the dog-breeding community, with widespread criticism directed at the kennel club. Since the broadcast, the BBC has withdrawn its television coverage of Crufts dog show in 2009, with other sponsors and partners also withdrawing their support, including Pedigree Petfoods, the RSPCA, PDSA and the Dog's Trust. In response to the programme, the Kennel Club in the UK announced a review of all breed standards, with the long-term goal being to eradicate hereditary health concerns. Most notably, they will impose a ban on breeding between dogs that are closely related and will impose greater monitoring to prevent unhealthy dogs from being entered for and winning awards at dog shows.", "A bench show is a show which requires dogs to be on display in an assigned location (show bench) during the entirety of the show except when being shown in the ring, groomed for showing, or taken outside to eliminate.

In the more common unbenched shows, dogs are required to be present only at assigned ring times.[15]", "In the United States benched shows used to be the norm, but now there are only six left including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show,[16] and the National Dog Show.[17]", "Among field trial participants, where dogs are judged on their performance and not their looks, the term bench show refers to any conformation show.[18]"]], "https://nds.nationaldogshow.com/": [{"h1": ["Watch the National Dog Show"], "h2": [], "h3": ["What To Expect", "Why is a \"Benched\" Dog Show So Special?", "The National Dog Show Presented By Purina", "Location"], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["Tune In Thanksgiving Day at noon on NBC", "The Kennel Club of Philadelphia competition will be presented as a single, two-day show on Nov. 14-15 at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center.
