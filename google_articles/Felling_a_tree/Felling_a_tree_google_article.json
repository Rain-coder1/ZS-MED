We have looked at the protective gear that is needed by an operator, the safety considerations with the use of the chainsaw itself, and some of the training that is available for chainsaw users.\u00a0\u00a0In this final installment, we will look at the actual felling of a tree.", "Some of the key points to make cuts to safely fell a tree. (see edit to original caption below)", "Safety is always of paramount concern when felling trees and the statistics bear this out, in that logging is the most hazardous occupation in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0Granted, much progress has been made in recent years, with more and more safety training and certification of loggers being demanded.\u00a0 However, many of the readers of this publication will not be professional loggers and oftentimes slip through the cracks with little or no formal training in the safe use of chainsaws.\u00a0\u00a0An important focus of this article will be on the use of the correct felling notches to use, which in recent years has changed dramatically.\nNow that we have arrived in the woods to fell trees, what are some of the precautions that we should take?\u00a0 First, you might consider having someone else nearby so that if anything bad occurs, that second person can summon help. The presence of a good first aid kit with a blood clotting sponge and trauma kit is imperative to have nearby as well, as well as a fully charged cell phone on your person.", "The safety zone once the tree starts to fall (B) is 45 degrees on either side from the direction of the fall (A)", "We need\u00a0to look at the tree that we are going to fell, and\u00a0 make sure\u00a0 that there are no \u201cwidow makers\u201d in or near that tree; widow makers are dead branches high overhead that can easily come crashing down on you. If they are present, go on to another tree!\u00a0You also don\u2019t want a tree to be near any power lines, houses, or other buildings. If the tree in question is near\u00a0buildings, perhaps it would be more prudent to hire an experienced arborist or\u00a0tree surgeon, rather than \u201cyour buddy from work\u201d who happens to own a chainsaw.\u00a0(Try explaining to your neighbor why there is a tree on top of their house or vehicle that you or \u201cyour buddy\u201d just dropped it onto; there will be red faces and lots of liability all around!).\u00a0You also need to clear any brushy stems in your\u00a0felling area\u00a0that might\u00a0get tangled up\u00a0and trip\u00a0you, or catch on your clothes and impede your escape when the tree begins to fall.\nYou will need to have a clear escape route to move to when the tree begins to fall, at about a 45-degree angle to the tree away from the felling direction. You do not want to be moving away from the falling tree in a straight line in the direction that it is falling; trees have been known to kickback off the stump and kill and injure people.\u00a0 This brings us to the crux of this article, the felling notches to be used.", "One of the included illustrations shows the long used, but now obsolete conventional felling notch, which should be replaced with open faced notches.\u00a0 Many publications still show this obsolete and unsafe notch, and\u00a0is\u00a0used by many people in practice, even in this modern era of new and better information available such as from\u00a0\u201cThe Game\u00a0of\u00a0Logging\u201d. What is wrong with this notch? The problem is that this notch oftentimes allows the tree to hang up on the notch when it falls to the ground, resulting in the tree still in the air and incompletely fallen.", "The open face felling notch\u00a0is part of the method known as directional felling, and\u00a0was promulgated by the world-renowned Soren Ericson, who brought much of these newer and more efficient felling methods to North America from Europe.\u00a0\u00a0These methods have been adopted by the forest products industry all over.\u00a0\u00a0The open face notch has now replaced the conventional\u00a0notch,\u00a0and the illustrations show the gist of the details.\u00a0 Directional felling allows you to control\u00a0exactly where the tree will fall, but does take a bit of training and experience to become competent in its methods.", "Directional felling, which uses a \u201cplunge\u201d cut and wedges to better control the safe felling of a tree.", "The safe felling of a tree\u00a0using an open face notch\u00a0consists of making three precise and strategic cuts; the top cut, the pluge cut, and the back or felling cut.\u00a0Felling wedges can then be used during the final cut to assist the tree in beginning to fall. Once the tree starts to fall, you move away from the tree at the aforementioned 45-degree angle as shown in the image. This technique is very safe once learned, but takes some dedicated practice to get it right.\nWhat do we do if the tree hangs up, and doesn\u2019t make it to the ground?\u00a0\u00a0This is where a logging winch mounted to a tractor comes in handy; and is much safer than just putting a chain around the tree and pulling it down with a tractor or other vehicle. The cable on the winch allows you to get a good safe distance away from the tree for when it does fall.\u00a0 Oh, by the way, the only people who never get trees hung up are those who never fell trees the right way.", "In conclusion, I strongly suggest that anyone who uses a chainsaw to attend a Game of Logging session; they are held frequently and all over the Northeast.\u00a0 Fell away, but be safe!", "Rich Taber (M.S./M.S.F.)\u00a0\u00a0is\u00a0an Educator with Cornell Cooperative Extension of\u00a0Chenango County\u00a0New York, and\u00a0 also owns a\u00a0165 acre\u00a0\u00a0farm in Madison County in the Hamilton/Morrisville area where he and his wife Wendy raise beef cattle, sheep, poultry, and enjoy their 105 acre woodlot.\u00a0 He can be reached at 607-334-5841, ext. 21, or rbt44@cornell.edu.", "Information about the \u201cGame of Logging\u201d can be found at their website, or the NY State Center for Agriculture Medicine and Health.", "NOTE: The caption for the first image was changed.

Which way is it leaning?\nStand back and hold an axe in front of you by the tip of\nthe handle.

This is the\nmost important indication of which direction the tree will\ngo.", "Next, look at the balance: If there are too many heavy\nbranches on one side, it may pull the tree over to that\nside. Pay close attention to the top of the tree; if it is\nnodding in one direction when the wind blows, this will\ninfluence the way the tree will fall.", "Check the trunk at about waist height-where you will be\ncutting-for rot. Look for holes in the trunk of the tree.\nSeveral large, dead branches on the tree may signify\ninterior decay. Any rot can influence the direction the\ntree will fall. If you have reason to believe there is\nconsiderable rot in the trunk of the tree, get the advice\nof an experienced tree cutter before proceeding.", "These four factors-lean, balance, wind and rot-will give\nyou a good idea of where the tree will land. With that in\nmind, look for a clear space, or bed, into which to drop\nthe tree, where it won\u2019t damage anything valuable or\nget hung up in the branches of another tree. Never try to\ndrop a tree up a steep slope-it could kick back at you when\nit hits the ground.", "You now know where you want to drop the tree and where the\ntree wants to fall. But do you both agree? If you and the\ntree are within 45 degrees of each other, you can proceed\nwithout any special cuts. If you are unsure of where the\ntree will fall, you can direct it by tying a rope or cable\nas high on the tree as you can reach. Either make certain\nthe rope is long enough that whoever is pulling does not\nend up under the tree, or put the rope around a tree out in\nfront of the spot you want your tree to fall, so that your\nhelper can pull from the side at a 90-degree angle. Also,\ncreate two escape routes so you can move away quickly as\nsoon as the tree begins to fall. Fix the routes firmly in\nyour mind.", "Dropping a Tree", "When you first try felling a tree, be prepared for the\npossibility that you will drop a tree in the wrong\ndirection. Learn from your mistakes and eventually\nyou\u2019ll master the craft.", "For small trees up to about 6 inches in diameter, you do\nnot need any fancy cuts. When you have cut about\nthree-quarters of the way through the tree, you can usually\nstand to one side and push the tree over into its bed.\nPushing with a forked stick is particularly effective.", "The traditional way of felling bigger trees is with an\nundercut and a back cut. It is possible to use an axe, but\nalso dangerous. Chopping tends to dislodge weak branches,\nwhich can fall on your head, and the lack of precision with\nan axe cut makes it harder to predict where the tree will\nfall. Using a saw-such as a chain saw or tubular-frame bow\nsaw-will make it easier to predict where the tree will\nfall, but you must exercise caution with these tools, too.", "The undercut is the first cut you will make. It should be\nmade on the side where you want the tree to fall. Begin at\nwaist height with a horizontal cut, continuing to about\none-third the distance through the tree. Pull out the saw\nand begin another cut, angling it downward, far enough\nabove the first to cut out a 45-degree wedge of wood.", "Make sure the horizontal cut is perpendicular to the\ndirection of the fall. You can check this with a handmade\nsighting stick or with a straight-handled double-bit axe.\nFacing the cut, insert the axe head into the wedge, resting\nit on the flat, first cut. The handle then should point in\nthe direction you want the tree to fall.", "Once you are certain that the undercut is correct, you can\nbegin the final cut, also known as the back or felling cut.\nGo around to the other side of the tree, opposite the\nundercut side, and saw into the tree about 2 inches above\nthe base of the undercut. Keep the cut horizontal;\ndon\u2019t angle it down. Keep sawing, while paying\ncareful attention to the hinge-the piece of uncut wood\nbetween the back cut and the undercut. The tree will topple\nbefore the saw cuts all the way through, and how it falls\nwill depend largely on the hinge. As you saw, try to keep\nthe hinge uniformly thick. If it is uneven, the tree may\ntear from the thin end of the hinge while hanging back on\nthe thick end, causing the tree to twist and fall in a\ndifferent direction than you planned.", "In addition to the hinge, keep a close watch on the\nkerf-the space that the saw leaves behind as you cut\nthrough the trunk. This space will give you your only\nadvance warning of how the tree is going to fall. When you\nget about one-third of the way toward the undercut, you\nshould notice the kerf getting slightly bigger. Good! This\nmeans the tree is beginning to lean toward the undercut,\nwhich is where you want it to go. Keep sawing-but never cut\nall the way through the hinge-until you hear the crack as\nthe tree leans enough to break the hinge. Remove the saw\nand back off quickly.", "If you notice that the kerf is closing up instead of\ngetting bigger, you have misjudged the lean or the balance\nof the tree and the tree will fall nowhere near the\ndirection of the undercut. Don\u2019t just keep sawing in\nthe hope that the tree will change its mind; trees\ndon\u2019t change their minds. If you keep sawing, the\nkerf will eventually close up, trapping your saw. Before\nthis happens, remove the saw and have your helper put\ntension on the rope attached to the tree to pull it over in\nthe right direction. Or put some wedges into the final cut\nto open the space; saw a bit more and then knock in the\nwedges a bit further until, as the tree is weakened, its\ntop is shifted in the right direction. If you opt for this\nmethod and you are using a chain saw, be sure to use wooden\nor plastic wedges and not metal ones that could damage the\nchain\u2019s teeth.", "It is possible that the hinge will get thinner and thinner,\nbut the tree will give no indication of which way it is\nheading because it is balanced on the hinge. It may fall\none way or the other; or with no hinge to guide it, the\ntree may slide off the stump and kick out at you. When you\nnotice this happening, stop sawing and use ropes, a pushing\nstick or wedges to get the tree down.", "If the tree does not fall completely, but instead gets\ncaught in the branches of another tree, there is only one\nsafe way to dislodge it-wrap a cable around the butt end\nand use a winch, come-along or truck to pull it free. Or\njust leave it in place, and do not try to cut it down.\nEventually the weight of the tree or wind may dislodge it;\nuntil then, avoid walking under the tree.", "Always take your time and think through each step. You can\nminimize injury by paying careful attention and stopping if\nyou are tired or confused. With practice and patience, you\ncan learn to fell a tree safely.", "Adapted from The Earth Manual: How to Work on Wild Land\nWithout Taming It by Malcolm Margolin, 1975. Used by\npermission of Heyday Books, Berkeley, Calif.", "Excellent description, especially the comments on what to watch for to predict problems: making sure the wedge cut is really at right angles to the intended direction of fall; making sure the back cut is level and exactly parallel to the wedge cut so the hinge is not thicker at one end than the other (which will cause the tree to turn and roll as it falls); and watching the behavior of the kerf for an indication of whether the tree wants to fall in a different direction than planned (and what to do about it). Very clear descriptions. The one thing I'd mention is that, for larger diameter trees (maybe 18\" and up), the practice I was taught is to make the back cut as a plunge cut through the center of the tree parallel to the wedge, and then to cut from the center of the tree out towards the side opposite the wedge. This requires really good saw control as you make the plunge to ensure that it is straight, level and leaves just enough hinge wood to guide the tree and prevent it from tearing off the stump -- between an inch to an inch and a half, in my experience. The advantages of this are that you will know if the tree is hollow or rotten center by feel; and as you come out of the back face of the tree with the saw, the saw bar does not get squeezed in the kerf. The disadvantages are that you get no early indication from the kerf behavior whether the tree will misbehave as it starts to fall, and not much chance to insert wedges if it does. So the initial choice of felling direction needs to be really accurate and well-judged. Also, with very large trees, using a line to coax the tree can be dangerous for the person pulling if the crown height is misjudged or it hits other trees on the way down and changes direction.", "Oh wow, that's quite interesting to know that the first cut should be at a 45 degree wedge.

Look at the tree from all\r\nangles to determine which way gravity is likely to pull it once you\r\nstart cutting. Be aware of wind strength and direction. If you have\r\nroom, allow the tree to fall where nature wants it to and make your\r\ncuts accordingly. Inexperienced tree fallers have been killed\r\ntrying to defy gravity to get a tree to fall in an unatural\r\ndirection. Large trees weigh several tons and will snap guide ropes\r\nand ignore wedges and hinges if gravity (and wind) have any say in\r\nthe matter. Be careful. Keep glancing up at the top of the tree\r\nwhile sawing for any indication of which direction the tree is\r\nfalling. Waiting to hear crack means the tree is falling and it may\r\nbe too late. Use your eyes and your brains. Park your truck outside\r\nthe radius of tree height or risk making an akward calim to your\r\ninsurance company.Inexperienced fallers need to take care not to\r\ncut the wedge too deep into the trunk or the tree is likely to fall\r\n180-degrees from where you wanted it to.Be careful...", "Tnank you for such timely tip. Here on Cape Cod, we are still\r\ncleaning up after an unexpected Nor'easter three weeks ago that\r\ndamanged literally thousands of trees, toppling many of them.It's\r\nworth noting that whether using a chain saw or a bow saw, one needs\r\nto make that first 45 degree wedge cut slowly and gradually,\r\ncutting first a little of the top of the angle, then removing the\r\nsaw and cutting a little of the bottom of the angle, and repeating\r\nthis until the wedge cut is complete.

While standing away from the tree, at a position 90 degrees to the direction of fall, sight up to the top of the tree using a weighted string or an axe as a plumb and note the location on the ground. The back lean is the distance from this point along the intended direction of fall to the apex of the planned undercut.

The stump diameter is used to determine the number of segments in the tree; one segment is a section of the tree with a height equal to the stump diameter. Thus, the 60-foot-tall tree with an 18-inch stump diameter has 40 segments (720 inches divided by 18 inches equals 40).", "If you raise the back edge of the lowest segment one inch, you will move its front edge one inch forward. At the same time, the top of our 40-segment tree will move forward 40 inches, enough to overcome its 3-foot back lean. If the same tree had a back lean of 4 feet, it would require 1 \u00bc inches of lift (48 inches divided by 40 sections = 1.2 inches) to overcome the lean. When calculating the lift, be sure to add in the 3/8-inch saw kerf, which means that one inch of lift will require 1 3/8 inches of wedge.", "A combination of wedges and shims can be used to give you more lift. Cut discs of \u00bd-inch to an inch in thickness from hardwood branches for the shims. Do not taper the discs, as that will make them weak and liable to break in the notch. Using two wedges, side by side, drive one home so that there is a gap between the stem and the top of the other wedge. Place a shim in the gap above the free wedge until it is snug, and then pound in the shim by driving the wedge. This should either fell the tree or free up the other wedge for a thicker shim. Repeat this process with increasingly larger shims until the tree comes up over the pivot point, and then gravity will take care of the rest.", "Tricks of the Trade is provided courtesy of the Forest and Wood Products Institute at Mount Wachusett Community College in Gardner, Massachusetts.

As the logger began his work, the conditions were winter-like with heavy snow falling that continued throughout the day. At approximately 9:00am, as the logger was felling a large oak tree approximately 18 inches in diameter, the logger cut an angled wedge from one side of the stump of the tree. He then made a cut from the backside of the tree meeting the wedge shaped cut in an effort to fell the tree. He cut almost cleanly through leaving approximately \u00bd inch section of connected wood in the center of the stump of the tree whereby the tree would hinge and rotate as it fell. As the tree began falling, it struck a standing tree with another tree that was crossed horizontally. The falling oak tree hit the two obstacle trees at approximately its balance point.

There was approximately \u00bd inch hinge of wood across the stump; there should have been a hinge more in the range of 1-2 inches in width to help control the tree as it fell. Additionally, the tree was felled in the direction of a snag, or crossed tree that was horizontal in the woods (Figure 2). As the tree fell, it struck both this crossed tree and the standing tree it was leaning against. At the point of contact, it created a pendulum effect that increased the pressure on the base of the tree throwing the butt section, or the bottom of the tree, out away from the stump. Since there was a not sufficient hinge section of wood connecting the stump to the butt of the tree, the butt of the tree shot out backwards away from the direction of the fall, allowing the butt to strike the logger as he vacated the cutting area. The logger appeared to be retreating in the correct path; unfortunately, he was struck and knocked down by the base of the tree during the unexpected kick-out.

In properly executed cuts, the creation of the notch positions the static load of the tree such that the sawyer, through the use of the back cut and the remaining hinge, can reliably control the direction the tree will fall. However, mistakes made during felling can result in property damage or serious injury/death to the feller or bystanders.", "Safe felling operations begin with proper inspection of the tree and of the conditions in an area 2.0 times the height of the tree to ensure it is free of people & property. The next step used in felling a tree is making three precise and strategic cuts. The graphic below depicts a \u201cconventional\u201d notch, but other notch styles are utilized depending on the circumstances of the cut. Sawyers must make informed decisions regarding the style of notch, as well as the depth of each cut to safely and reliably fell trees.", "These cuts should be done by a sawyer who has been trained and wears the appropriate personal protective equipment like gloves, eye protection, hearing protection, head protection with face shield, chainsaw chaps, and steel-toed boots. The chainsaw selected for felling trees must be the appropriate size (bar length) for cutting the subject tree and must be sharp and in good repair. Having the appropriate equipment like tree felling wedges, taglines, and other tree felling gear may assist in the efficient and safe felling of trees.", "Pre-Work Inspection", "The first step in felling a tree is for the sawyer to look for a straight tree and has an equal size diameter that is free of bulges or irregular architecture. If the tree is leaning or has a slight lean the sawyer should use a level or a plumb line to determine how much lean and what direction it leans. The sawyer should plan the felling operation in the direction of the tree\u2019s existing lean. Trees with structural defects are potentially dangerous candidates for felling. Trees with spiraling of the bark indicate spiraling of the interior wood grains, which may make it difficult to control the direction of the fall. Trees with dead branches or pockets of rotten wood are also difficult to fell by conventional notch and drop operations. The sawyer should examine the base of the tree. If the base is hollow or one side of the tree has rotten wood, it may not be a suitable choice for felling operations since the rotten wood will affect the direction that the tree falls.", "Drop Zone", "The next step is for the tree sawyer to determine if the path of the tree\u2019s intended fall is clear of obstacles and targets.

The tree sawyer should make sure there are no obstacles like buildings, trees or other physical barriers that will block his/her to escape if the tree begins to fail without warning during the cutting operation. The pathway of escape should be at a 45 degree angle (see photo below) in either opposite direction of the intended direction of the felling path and at least 20 feet from the base of the subject tree being felled (see photo below). The tree sawyer should always assume that the tree will fall in EVERY possible direction and take measure to ensure nothing can be harmed regardless of which way the tree falls.

This means checking to note that the chain brake is working, saw dogs are attached to the saw housing, the bar is as long as the diameter of the tree you\u2019ll be cutting, and that the chain has recently been sharpened.", "If you notice that the chain saw is dull, damaged, or just not cutting straight, immediately stop cutting down your dead tree.", "Make a plan.", "Don\u2019t just step up to a dead tree and start cutting. First, make a plan that includes felling-to-lead. This means that you are cutting in a way that ensures the tree will fall in a certain direction. In this case, the tree is angled 30 to 45 degrees to either side of the skid trail.", "Keep an eye out for potential \u201cwidow makers\u201d. These are tree fragments that could potentially fall and cause serious injury (hence the name) during the felling process.", "Notice the weather.

This can hamper vision at the tree crown, as well as obscure potential widow makers. If the tree sits on a", "steep or uneven slope, this can also quickly turn into a dangerous situation. Skip DIY felling altogether and call in the professionals. Better safe than sorry.", "Think about the tree itself.", "Dead or rotten trees are more likely to cause an unsafe situation when felling. They often have loose limbs and bark and unstable tops. These loose limbs are more susceptible to outside forces and are more likely to fall unpredictably. If you know your tree is dead or rotting, it is strongly recommended that you leave cutting down dead trees to the professionals.", "Additional unsafe conditions include trees with sharp curves near the base, which are more likely to uproot during felling; alder and maple trees, which are susceptible to hidden rotten heart wood; and trees near utility lines, roads, or other houses.", "Make an escape plan.", "Felling trees is inherently dangerous, so think ahead of time about how you and your workers will escape potential emergency scenarios. Your path should lead as far away from the stump as possible and be clear of shrubs, rocks, or any other obstacles. You also want the path to be in the opposite direction of where you expect the tree to fall.", "If you are unable to create a clear escape path, call in the professional tree fellers.", "Now, start with the undercut.", "So, if after reading the above you still want to cut down your tree, then you\u2019re ready to begin, and this first step is the undercut. This is the notch cut in the tree that allows it to safely fall. This is the cut that determines the direction the tree will fall, so it\u2019s one of the most important steps. Based on your goals, you\u2019ll either want to go with the conventional undercut, Humboldt undercut, or open-face undercut. Note that the undercut is the proper depth, the cuts are level, and that the cuts match-up.", "Next, it\u2019s time for the back cut.", "This is the cut that actually causes the tree to fall. It\u2019s made horizontally and must be at least as high as the horizontal undercut. Do not make the back cut lower than the undercut. This could cause the tree to move backward toward you.", "Before this cut, stop the chain saw and give a warning call to those around you. Do not intersect the back cut and the undercut. Instead, leave a bit of uncut wood between the two cuts. Then, as soon as possible, insert a falling wedge into the back cut. The wedge will help ease the tree in the right direction and can also help you adjust if it starts leaning the wrong way.", "If the tree doesn\u2019t fall after these steps, drive in the wedge using an axe until it does.", "Keep an eye outduring this process.", "Don\u2019t forget to continually look around and ensure the environment is safe.

It\u2019s important to observe from multiple angles. Trees that appear to be perfectly straight from one angle may, in fact, have pronounced leans. A leaning tree acts differently from a straight tree as you cut and as it falls.", "It\u2019s your job to make cuts that manage the hinge-point you\u2019re creating, so it supports the tree until you\u2019re ready for it to fall.\u00a0 A tall tree carries a lot of weight high off the ground. If your hinge is too weak and allows the tree to begin to lean before you\u2019re ready, pressure can build above the hinge and the trunk can snap resulting in a dangerous and uncontrolled event. It\u2019s critical your hinge maintains its integrity and bears the weight of the tree until you make the final cut.", "Once you determine where the tree will fall, plan an escape route so you can get a safe distance away. Stay far away from the stump since during the fall, the tree may \u201ckick back\u201d violently at the stump. Clean up the escape route as needed before felling to ensure the area is free of debris and hazards.", "There are several types of cuts you can make depending on the tree.\u00a0 The first cut to make is the notch cut on the face of the tree on the side where it will fall.\u00a0 There are three basic notch cuts:", "Next, a bore cut is made about a 1.5\u201d behind the bottom of the notch. This cut sets up the hinge. It\u2019s important the bore cut does not break the hinge by cutting through to the notch at any point.\u00a0 When making a bore cut, keep in mind the dynamics of the saw. Begin a bore cut by contacting the tree at the lower tip of the chain. Using the top of the chain will cause the saw to kick back toward you. We call the bar top the \u201cno-go-zone.\u201d", "You can bore completely through the tree. When through, set the chain brake and remove the saw from the cut. Pull the saw out of the bore while the chain is stopped to prevent cutting through the hinge, which could create a dangerously unstable tree.", "Next, re-insert the saw and cut toward the backside. Cut about 80% through, leaving a section of \u201cholding wood\u201d to keep the tree stable. It\u2019s advisable to insert a wedge into the backside cut as soon as possible to prevent the tree from leaning away from the hinge and potentially binding the saw.", "Now the tree is ready to fall. Re-examine the surroundings, the fall zone, and escape route. Make the final cut through the holding wood on the tree back. Once the back cut is made and the tree begins to fall, move away.", "Occasionally, after making the final cut, wedges may also be required to help the fall. This is common with trees leaning opposite the desired felling direction. If the tree doesn\u2019t begin to fall after the back cut, strike the wedge already in position with the axe butt until the tree kerf (the groove created by cutting) begins to open. Watch the kerf closely and evacuate as it opens.", "Once the tree falls, it\u2019s time to \u201climb and buck\u201d for removal. A tree resting its branches on the ground is still a hazard. Use care in relieving the pressure on branches to prevent the saw from binding and to ensure the tree doesn\u2019t roll uncontrollably.
