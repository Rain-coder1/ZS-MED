(They met when Deanna was in the Arizona State University marching band, and Brian assisted the drum majors.) Brian worked at an art museum and a restaurant before getting a job fixing instruments at a music shop. Deanna worked for a resort and spa and was a substitute music teacher.", "HOW IT ALL STARTED\nAfter working three years for another musical instrument repair shop, Brian had often thought about opening his own. (Actually, the idea first occurred to him as a child watching Mr. Rogers repair musical instruments.) In November 2012, the shop\u2019s owner hinted that layoffs were coming, and Brian and Deanna, who had a 6-month-old daughter, \u201cdecided to take fate into their own hands.\u201d", "They planned to start their business out of their house.

Their cabinetry came from the Habitat for Humanity ReStore.", "Because Brian always planned to have his own shop, he\u2019d slowly been amassing in his own instrument repair tools. Still, the tools are so specialized, he had to invest $10,000 in new ones plus $10,000 in instrument parts and supplies to open the store. But he holds off buying new tools until they have a job that requires them. The $4,000 machine that removes dents from the bell of a French Horn, for example, wasn\u2019t purchased until a customer walked in with a horn he\u2019d run over with his car.", "\u201cThe bell looked like a taco salad bowl,\u201d Deanna remembers. To complete that job, Brian reached out to an industry network online and found someone in North Carolina who was willing to sell a used machine to him for only $850.", "Brian says they also \u201clook for ways to be creative about how you can get things done without cash.\u201d One example \u2013 they give school music teachers store credit in exchange for old instruments \u201cthat have probably been sitting in their storage closets for 20 years.\u201d Brian then repairs the instruments and sells them in the store.", "BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OWNING AND WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE\nThe Stevensons have been able to tailor their business to meet their family\u2019s needs. Their daughter Emily, now 4, is in the shop a few hours a week and even has her own \u201coffice\u201d filled with toys, movies, a starter toolbox and broken trumpet so that she can \u201cwork\u201d alongside her dad. When she was an infant, she and Deanna were in the shop full time, and now that Emily\u2019s older, Deanna has been able to cut back her own hours in the office.", "One more family member has a role in the shop \u2013 Rocky Mountain Music Repair\u2019s official greeter, a yellow Lab named Sawyer. Deanna laughs thinking about how she would have never been able to bring him to her former job at the resort spa.", "\u201cMy shop, my rules,\u201d Brian added. \u201cWhen we posted the job listing for our part-time employee, we said, \u2018There\u2019s a dog and a kid here. If that\u2019s a problem, this might not be the job for you.\u2019\u201d", "PROUDEST MOMENT SO FAR\nBrian clearly remembers, about four months after opening the shop, he got the first phone call from a school asking him to repair their broken band instruments. It was proof that Rocky Mountain Music Repair was starting to build a reputation. Today, they work with all the elementary schools in their town, as well as several high school bands. They\u2019re even starting to get the most coveted work \u2013 universities.", "BIGGEST SURPRISE\nThe Stevensons expected the vast majority of their revenue would come from repairing instruments people owned, but now, 40 percent of their business is selling instruments Brian\u2019s refurbished.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pivot to what people want,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started with two [used] flutes and a clarinet. Now we have more than 300 instruments waiting to be repaired and sold.\u201d", "SOMETHING THEY\u2019VE\u00a0STRUGGLED WITH\nFall is the repair shop\u2019s busy period. It\u2019s back-to-school time and marching band season, so Brian and Deanna often work six days a week, well into the evenings. The first year, they had more than their share of fast-food family dinners. But this year, they planned ahead.", "\u201cDeanna bought 20 pounds of beef, 20 pounds of chicken and 20 pounds of pork, and made a ton of freezer meals,\u201d Brian said. \u201cWe\u2019d dump them in the crockpot here, have a family dinner in the shop and keep right on working. It saved our health, and it saved money.\u201d", "BEST ADVICE TO BUSINESS OWNERS JUST STARTING OUT\n\u201cBe part of the community, and show them you love what you do,\u201d Brian says. He points to the times he and Deanna set up shop at high school band festivals, offering free repairs to students having trouble with their instruments before a performance. \u201cIf a kid drops his trumpet, you never want that to be the reason he can\u2019t perform,\u201d Brian said.", "In this way, the Stevensons have met many grateful parents and band directors who later become the shop\u2019s paying customers. \u201cWe want them to know we\u2019re not just in it for the money,\u201d Brian said. \u201cWe care about the community.\u201d", "Share:", "Kathryn, a journalist, co-founded Owning My Own with her sister, Annie.

Instrument repair techs are expert at\u00a0assessing an instrument's problems, recommending a realistic repair based on the instrument's age, condition, and quality, and performing the necessary work\u2014whether it's a minor tweak or a major overhaul.", "Most instrument repair technicians are also skilled players, intimately familiar with the instruments they repair.", "In addition to their practical repair duties, technicians also educate and advise customers about caring for and maintaining their instruments. Those who cater to professionals often perform special modifications and services to customize an instrument to meet a particular musician's preferences and needs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most instrument repair technicians are also skilled players, intimately familiar with the instruments they repair.\u00a0Because instrument repair techniques are highly complex and not necessarily transferable, most instrument repair technicians specialize in one type or category of instruments, such as strings, brass and woodwinds, or electric guitars and basses. A notable exception to this rule can be found in the field of concert and touring instrument repair and maintenance. While still specialized, touring instrument techs are largely valued for their familiarity with many types of instrument, which aids in reducing touring personnel costs.", "Most instrument repair technicians attend instrument repair school or study instrument repair as part of their music education, although some are self-taught. Before beginning their own professional careers, aspiring instrument repair techs might apprentice with a more experienced and established tech. From there, they might start their own business making, repairing, and/or selling instruments, find employment in the repair section of a larger music shop, or go on tour with artists as touring instrument techs. Those who take a freelance approach to the career might combine stints on tour with consistent work maintaining the instruments owned by local recording studios, for example, or occasional gigs as a piano tuner. The most successful instrument repair techs might gain the exclusive business of prominent clients, or shift into the field of making instruments.", "Instrument repair technicians often find jobs at music stores or instrument repair shops, or work as independent contractors out of their homes. They may also go on tour with bands or artists as instrument techs. In order to find consistent work as an instrument repair technician, it is important to network with musicians, acquire strong references, and build a great reputation. One should never forget that\u00a0it takes a great deal of trust for professional musicians to hand their instruments over to a stranger; this is why building a solid clientele takes not just skill, but time, consistency, and a genuine ability to make interpersonal connections.", "Instrument repair is precise, solitary work.

The amount of the fine was increased by 15% after it emerged the activity appeared to have continued after GAK received an advisory letter from the CMA, making it aware that there was evidence suggesting it might be engaging in RPM. In contrast, Yamaha was granted total immunity from fines for being the first to bring the conduct to the attention of the CMA.", "Building on its extensive efforts to monitor and address suspected RPM, the CMA has launched its own in-house price monitoring tool aimed at deterring companies from entering into agreements restricting online discounting.

The CMA intends that this tool will be used to monitor suspicious pricing activity in other sectors in the future to help protect more customers purchasing online.", "Given the prevalence of RPM in the musical instrument sector, the CMA has issued an open letter to the industry highlighting the illegal activity it has uncovered and urging compliance with the law.", "The CMA has also written to almost 70 manufacturers and retailers across the sector, warning them about their conduct. These warning letters make the recipients aware that the CMA suspects their online pricing arrangements may have been illegal and that they need to take swift action to ensure they are complying with the law or potentially risk an investigation and fines.
