Companies like Sears and Vitaminwater, for example, have hired Jason Laws to be director, choreographer and producer for marketing events they bill as flash mobs. Among his many tasks on these jobs, Law says, is to come up with a concept with his client and then storyboard how it will work, audition and hire performers, as well as secure permits from local authorities. Besides this commercial bent, flash mob is the term that was also applied to impromptu gatherings of young people in Philadelphia in 2010.

Still others appreciate the spontaneous and creative nature of flash mobs. In that regard, there really is no limit to what can be done. For his part, Moriarty has participated in flash mobs where a group gets together for a fake protest, the only direction being to act passionately and come up with a three-word chant that nobody could interpret as being an actual cause: \"I hate bananas\" was one.", "Another flash mob Moriarty helped organize involved around 100 people dressing up like Waldo from \"Where's Waldo?\" and showing up at a mall food court.

When flash mob creator Bill Wasik first organized flash mobs in New York City, he did it in a very simple, straightforward way: He sent out e-mails to people in his address book and they forwarded the message along to their contacts. Today, people rely on all sorts of technology -- not just e-mail, but text messages, blogs and Facebook -- to get the word out about planned flash mobs.", "But the viral nature inherent in social media also makes it hard to straddle the line between generating interest and keeping it secret enough to be a surprise. When Moriarty wants to keep his plans as under wraps as possible, he waits until just a couple of days before his event before sending out an e-mail to possible participants -- even by doing this, though, Moriarty knows there are no guarantees that the flash mob will be a complete surprise.", "Advertisement", "Advertisement", "The message sent out is also important. If the goal is to organize an event that gives those who show up the opportunity to exercise a little creativity of their own, it's best to keep the instructions short, simple and fairly broad: A silent disco is popular because everyone can decide what music to listen to and how to dance.", "Simple, general instructions are also best because flash mobs, at least in their original spirit, are leaderless. A few other tips for organizing a flash mob include picking as well known a public or quasi-public place for the gathering as possible -- attracting attention from passersby is a goal -- and scouring YouTube for ideas about what to do.", "Professionals organizing flash mobs as marketing events are obliged to obtain permits and insurance. But generally speaking, contacting stores or the police asking for permission doesn't happen because it would ruin any chance for surprise. Common sense goes a long way in making sure nobody gets hurt or lands in jail. Picking an activity that doesn't damage property or risk injury is a helpful start and listening when police or private security say to stop or move on helps ensure there's not a bad ending.", "Advertisement", "Citation & Date |\n\t\tReprint", "Advertisement", "Advertisement", "Advertisement", "Advertisement", "Advertisement", "Advertisement", "Advertisement", "Get the best of HowStuffWorks by email!", "Keep up to date on: Latest Buzz \u00b7 Stuff Shows & Podcasts \u00b7 Tours \u00b7 Weird & Wacky", "Copyright \u00a9 2020 HowStuffWorks, a division of InfoSpace Holdings, LLC, a System1 Company", "Privacy Choices", "We use cookies to personalise content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic.

Anyone approached by a sales assistant was advised to say that the gatherers lived together in a warehouse on the outskirts of New York, that they were shopping for a \"love rug\", and that they made all their purchase decisions as a group.[20] Subsequently, 200 people flooded the lobby and mezzanine of the Hyatt hotel in synchronized applause for about 15 seconds, and a shoe boutique in SoHo was invaded by participants pretending to be tourists on a bus trip.[9]", "Wasik claimed that he created flash mobs as a social experiment designed to poke fun at hipsters and to highlight the cultural atmosphere of conformity and of wanting to be an insider or part of \"the next big thing\".[9] The Vancouver Sun wrote, \"It may have backfired on him\u00a0... [Wasik] may instead have ended up giving conformity a vehicle that allowed it to appear nonconforming.\"[21] In another interview he said \"the mobs started as a kind of playful social experiment meant to encourage spontaneity and big gatherings to temporarily take over commercial and public areas simply to show that they could\".[22]", "In 19th-century Tasmania, the term flash mob was used to describe a subculture consisting of female prisoners, based on the term flash language for the jargon that these women used. The 19th-century Australian term flash mob referred to a segment of society, not an event, and showed no other similarities to the modern term flash mob or the events it describes.[23]", "In 1973, the story \"Flash Crowd\" by Larry Niven described a concept similar to flash mobs.[24] With the invention of popular and very inexpensive teleportation, an argument at a shopping mall\u2014which happens to be covered by a news crew\u2014quickly swells into a riot. In the story, broadcast coverage attracts the attention of other people, who use the widely available technology of the teleportation booth to swarm first that event\u2014thus intensifying the riot\u2014and then other events as they happen. Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, \"We call them flash crowds, and we watch for them.\" In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place. Lev Grossman suggests that the story title is a source of the term \"flash mob\"[25]", "Flash mobs began as a form of performance art.[18] While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political demonstrations.  In the 1960s, groups such as the Yippies used street theatre to expose the public to political issues.[26]  Flash mobs can be seen as a specialized form of smart mob,[7] a term and concept proposed by author Howard Rheingold in his 2002 book Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution.[27]", "The first documented use of the term flash mob as it is understood today was in 2003 in a blog entry posted in the aftermath of Wasik's event.[17][19][28] The term was inspired by the earlier term smart mob.[29]", "Flash mob was added to the 11th edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary on July 8, 2004 where it noted it as an \"unusual and pointless act\" separating it from other forms of smart mobs such as types of performance, protests, and other gatherings.[3][30] Also recognized noun derivatives are flash mobber and flash mobbing.[3] Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English defines flash mob as \"a group of people who organize on the Internet and then quickly assemble in a public place, do something bizarre, and disperse.\"[31]  This definition is consistent with the original use of the term; however, both news media and promoters have subsequently used the term to refer to any form of smart mob, including political protests;[32] a collaborative Internet denial of service attack;[33] a collaborative supercomputing demonstration;[34] and promotional appearances by pop musicians.[35]  The press has also used the term flash mob to refer to a practice in China where groups of shoppers arrange online to meet at a store in order to drive a collective bargain.[36]", "The city of Brunswick, Germany has stopped flash mobs by strictly enforcing the already existing law of requiring a permit to use any public space for an event.[37] In the United Kingdom, a number of flash mobs have been stopped over concerns for public health and safety.[38] The British Transport Police have urged flash mob organizers to \"refrain from holding such events at railway stations\".[39]", "Referred to as flash robs, flash mob robberies, or flash robberies by the media, crimes organized by teenage youth using social media rose to international notoriety beginning in 2011.[12][13][14][40] The National Retail Federation does not classify these crimes as \"flash mobs\" but rather \"multiple offender crimes\" that utilize \"flash mob tactics\".[41][42] In a report, the NRF noted, \"multiple offender crimes tend to involve groups or gangs of juveniles who already know \neach other, which does not earn them the term \"flash mob\".\"[42] Mark Leary, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, said that most \"flash mob thuggery\" involves crimes of violence that are otherwise ordinary, but are perpetrated suddenly by large, organized groups of people: \"What social media adds is the ability to recruit such a large group of people, that individuals who would not rob a store or riot on their own feel freer to misbehave without being identified.\"[43]", "It's hard for me to believe that these kids saw some YouTube video of people Christmas caroling in a food court, and said, 'Hey, we should do that, except as a robbery!' More likely, they stumbled on the simple realization (like I did back in 2003, but like lots of other people had before and have since) that one consequence of all this technology is that you can coordinate a ton of people to show up in the same place at the same time.", "These kids are taking part in what's basically a meme. They heard about it from friends, and probably saw it on YouTube, and now they're getting their chance to participate in it themselves.", "HuffPost raised the question asking if \"the media was responsible for stirring things up\", and added that in some cases the local authorities did not confirm the use of social media making the \"use of the term flash mob questionable.\"[15] Amanda Walgrove wrote that criminals involved in such activities don't refer to themselves as \"flash mobs\", but that this use of the term is nonetheless appropriate.[44] Dr. Linda Kiltz drew similar parallels between flash robs and the Occupy Movement stating, \"As the use of social media increases, the potential for more flash mobs that are used for political protest and for criminal purposes is likely to increase.\".[45]"]], "https://archive.shine.cn/feature/Flash-mob-mania/shdaily.shtml": [{"h1": [], "h2": ["Home", "Business", "Metro", "Nation", "World", "Sports", "Feature", "Opinion", "Sunday", "Flash mob mania"], "h3": ["Email this to your friend"], "h4": ["Suzhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued rise brings it closer to Shanghai", "Provisional EU nod for 737 MAX", "Bitcoin soars to near all-time high", "Digital economy is \u00e2\u0080\u0098new growth engine\u00e2\u0080\u0099", "Women who regain the \u00e2\u0080\u0098symbol of beauty\u00e2\u0080\u0099", "New water treatment tech", "Fake mask maker jailed", "50 people prosecuted in Pudong over online fraud", "Management regulations for food vendors updated", "Resident cop helps out in quarantined complex", "Guoan edges closer to last 16 as Shenhua also seals ACL victory", "Fans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 return brings new set of headaches for clubs", "Diamond League season to start in Morocco on May 23", "FIFA bans CAF president for 5 years", "The show goes on at Madrid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opera house", "Australian expert fattens up Gansu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  sheep industry", "Revolution-themed tourism lifts rural residents out of poverty", "Embracing culture of East and West", "E-learning an emerging industry amid pandemic", "YCIS help students grow in activities", "Hidden socioeconomic impact of COVID-19", "Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech at APEC CEO Dialogues talks up new opportunities", "Public development banks can lead to a fair and green recovery", "RCEP deal a victory for multilateralism, free trade", "China shows pledge to globalization and free trade by embracing reform and opening-up", "Forum addresses further reform and opening-up", "AC/DC is back with \u00e2\u0080\u0098Power Up\u00e2\u0080\u0099", "Marshes clue to birds surviving hurricanes", "Princess Diana makes dramatic debut in British royal family series", "Gillian Anderson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncanny portrayal of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Iron Lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099", "\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099 roles are not for keeps", "Filipino bands\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pain as virus mutes nightlife"], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf", "View more \u00c2\u00bbLatest Business News", "Explore Business", "Auto", "Autotalk Special", "Benchmark", "Biz Commentary", "Biz Special", "Consumer", "Economy", "Energy", "Finance", "Finance Special", "IT", "Manufacturing", "Media", "Real estate", "Real Estate Special", "Transport", "View more \u00c2\u00bbLatest Metro News", "Explore Metro", "Education", "Entertainment and culture", "Environment", "Expat community", "Health and science", "In-depth", "Interactive", "Services", "Society", "View more \u00c2\u00bbLatest Sports News", "Explore Sports", "American football", "Athletics", "Awards", "Badminton", "Baseball", "Basketball", "Boxing", "Cricket", "Cycling", "Diving", "Doping", "East Asian games", "Golf", "Gymnastics", "Ice hockey", "Motor racing", "Motorcycling", "Olympics", "Rugby", "Sailing", "Skating", "Skiing", "Snooker", "Soccer", "Swimming", "Table tennis", "Tennis", "View more \u00c2\u00bbLatest Feature News", "Explore Feature", "Animal planet", "Art and culture", "Community", "District special", "Education", "News Feature", "People", "Events and TV", "Health and environment", "iDEAL", "Travel", "Mice", "StyleHai", "View more \u00c2\u00bbLatest Opinion News", "Explore Opinion", "Opinion Columns", "Book review", "China Knowledge", "Chinese Views", "Foreign Views", "Global Lens on China", "View more \u00c2\u00bbOpinion Columns", "Opinion deputy editor of Shanghai Daily", "", "View more \u00c2\u00bbLatest Vibe News", "Explore Vibe", "Book", "City scene", "Film", "Home and design", "Now and then", "Style", "Technology", "The story appears on", "Page B1", "May 16, 2014", "GET this page in PDF", "Free for subscribers", "View shopping cart", "Related News", "Home \n                    \n                        \u00c2\u00bb Feature", "", "OUT of nowhere, around 30 couples materialize in crowded Nanjing Road Pedestrian Mall and onlookers stare as they embrace and kiss long and passionately.

If attending the mob requires some sort of prop, such as pillow, participants are expected to conceal the props until the starting time of the event, to maintain an air of mystery and to avoid alarming law enforcement. Usually, organizers choose harmless and non-threatening props to avoid antagonizing police, and also ask that participants not involve people who are not actively participating in the flash mob, to avoid upsetting innocent bystanders.", "In another organizing technique, participants are told that an event is occurring, but are not given details. Instead, they assemble at multiple pre-staging locations where they are given their assignments and then proceed to the rally point. Organizing in this way prevents news of the details from leaking out, and also allows organizers to stage large and complex events.", "Numerous improv and street theatre groups organize flash mobs including No Pants Day and the Mp3 Experiment, two famous events organized by New York City group Improv Everywhere. The general purpose is to create a light-hearted gathering of people to intrigue and mystify bystanders. In the Mp3 Experiment, for example, participants downloaded musical tracks before attending the event, and spontaneously broke into dance, following instructions embedded in the tracks. During No Pants Day, participants ride the New York City subway system without pants.", "A flash mob differs from a political gathering in two primary ways. The first is that organizers do not apply for permits to gather. They rely on the Internet to spread information about the event, and participants try to gather and disperse quickly to evade detainment by law enforcement. A flash mob also usually does not have a political motive; the point is to have fun, not necessarily to make a statement.", "Ever since she began contributing to the site several years ago, Mary has embraced the\nexciting challenge of being a wiseGEEK researcher and writer.

The pillow fights can last from a few minutes to several hours.[1]", "The largest pillow fight flash mob was the Worldwide Pillow Fight Day (or International Pillow Fight Day[3]) that took place on March 22, 2008.

The first attempt was unsuccessful after the targeted retail store was tipped off about the plan for people to gather. Wasik avoided such problems during the first successful flash mob, which occurred on June 3, 2003 at Macy's department store, by sending participants to preliminary staging areas-in four Manhattan bars-where they received further instructions about the ultimate event and location just before the event began.", "More than 130 people converged upon the ninth floor rug department of the store, gathering around an expensive rug. Anyone approached by a sales assistant was advised to say that the gatherers lived together in a warehouse on the outskirts of New York, that they were shopping for a \"love rug\", and that they made all their purchase decisions as a group. Subsequently, 200 people flooded the lobby and mezzanine of the Hyatt hotel in synchronized applause for about 15 seconds, and a shoe boutique in SoHo was invaded by participants pretending to be tourists on a bus trip.", "Wasik claimed that he created flash mobs as a social experiment designed to poke fun at hipsters and to highlight the cultural atmosphere of conformity and of wanting to be an insider or part of \"the next big thing\". The Vancouver Sun wrote, \"It may have backfired on him ... [Wasik] may instead have ended up giving conformity a vehicle that allowed it to appear nonconforming.\" In another interview he said \"the mobs started as a kind of playful social experiment meant to encourage spontaneity and big gatherings to temporarily take over commercial and public areas simply to show that they could\".", "In 19th-century Tasmania, the term flash mob was used to describe a subculture consisting of female prisoners, based on the term flash language for the jargon that these women used. The 19th-century Australian term flash mob referred to a segment of society, not an event, and showed no other similarities to the modern term flash mob or the events it describes.", "In 1973, the story \"Flash Crowd\" by Larry Niven described a concept similar to flash mobs. With the invention of popular and very inexpensive teleportation, an argument at a shopping mall-which happens to be covered by a news crew-quickly swells into a riot. In the story, broadcast coverage attracts the attention of other people, who use the widely available technology of the teleportation booth to swarm first that event-thus intensifying the riot-and then other events as they happen.

This goal is the blackest spot where most people are gathered.\u2014Elias Canetti", "introduction", "Before we break down our present cultural situation, it will be worthwhile to revisit the concept of deindividuation, which psychologists put forward in the mid-twentieth century to address the question of evil more generally. As first defined by Festinger, Pepitone, and Newcomb (1952), deindividuation is \u201ca state of affairs in a group where members do not pay attention to other individuals qua individuals\u201d; when in a crowd or pack, the theory ran, each man sees he doesn\u2019t stand out and so his inhibitions melt away. Indeed, the writers observed, even \u201cthe delegates to an American Legion convention, all dressed in the same uniform manner, will sometimes exhibit an almost alarming lack of restraint.\u201d Zimbardo (1969) broke down the causation into ten input variables, enumerated A through J, ranging from anonymity (A) and arousal (E) to sensory input overload (F) and altered states of consciousness (J). Experimental heft was soon supplied by Diener, Fraser, Beaman, and Kelem (1976) in their paper \u201cEffects of Deindividuation Variables on Stealing Among Halloween Trick-or-Treaters,\u201d which put hard numbers to the theory (see Figure 1).", "fig. 1\u2014percentage of children transgressing", "Nonanonymous", "", "In recent decades, the concept of deindividuation has fallen into scientific neglect, and yet I believe that it possesses great theoretical usefulness today. Consider the generational cohort that has come to be called the hipsters\u2014i.e., those hundreds of thousands of educated young urbanites with strikingly similar tastes. Have so many self-alleged aesthetes ever been more (in the formulation of Festinger et al.) \u201csubmerged in the group\u201d? The hipsters make no pretense to divisions on principle, to forming intellectual or artistic camps; at any given moment, it is the same books, records, films that are judged au courant by all, leading to the curious spectacle of an \u201calternative\u201d culture more unanimous than the mainstream it ostensibly opposes. What critical impulse does exist among their number merely causes a favorite to be more readily abandoned, as abandoned\u2014whether Friendster.com, Franz Ferdinand, or Jonathan Safran Foer\u2014it inevitably will be. Once abandoned, it is never taken up again.", "Over those who would sell to the hipsters, then, hangs the promise of instant adoption but also the specter of wholesale and irrevocable desertion. One thinks of Volkswagen, which for years has produced lavish network spots with plots that play to hipster preoccupations, all artfully shot on grainy stock, layered over with the latest in ethereal priss-pop, and for what? Fleeting ubiquity and then ruin; today the company is in disastrous straits, its target U.S. demographic once again favoring Toyotas, Hondas, and even the upstart Koreans. With a rising generation so mercurial, one wonders whether even the notion of \u201cbranding,\u201d i.e., the building of long-term reputations, which has remained the watchword among our corporations for more than a decade, will itself come to lose its luster; whether the triumph of Internet commerce, the widening readership of online news and blogs (with the concomitant narrowing of the news cycle, such that stories are often considered stale by the time a newspaper can print them), and the proliferation of cable television channels (many of which are devoted either explicitly to shopping or effectively to product placement) will swing tastes so faddishly that rather than courting consumers for life, the corporation will be content merely to hitch itself to a succession of their whims.", "Perhaps this is the explanation for Fusion Flash Concerts, an otherwise inexplicable marketing program this past summer in which Ford, attempting to sell a new sedan to the underthirty- five market, partnered with Sony to appropriate what may be the most forgettable hipster fad of the past five years. That fad is the \u201cflash mob,\u201d which, according to a definition hastily added in 2004 to the Oxford English Dictionary, is \u201ca public gathering of complete strangers, organized via the Internet or mobile phone, who perform a pointless act and then disperse again.\u201d In fact the flash mob, which dates back only to June 2003, had almost entirely died out by that same winter, despite its having spread during those few months to all the world\u2019s continents save Antarctica. Not only was the flash mob a vacuous fad; it was, in its very form (pointless aggregation and then dispersal), intended as a metaphor for the hollow hipster culture that spawned it.", "I know this because I happen to have been the flash mob\u2019s inventor. My association with the fad has heretofore remained semi-anonymous, on a first-name- only basis to all but friends and acquaintances. For more than two years, I concealed my identity for scientific purposes, but now that my experiment is essentially complete, corporate America having fulfilled (albeit a year later than expected) its final phase, I finally feel compelled to offer a report: on the flash mob, its life and times, and its consummation this summer in the clutches of the Ford Motor Company.", "phase 1: initial experiment", "On May 27, 2003, bored and therefore disposed toward acts of social-scientific inquiry, I sent an email to sixty-some friends and acquaintances. The message began:", "You are invited to take part in MOB, the project that creates an inexplicable mob of people in New York City for ten minutes or less. Please forward this to other people you know who might like to join.", "More precisely, I forwarded them this message, which, in order to conceal my identity as its original author, I had sent myself earlier that day from an anonymous webmail account. As further explanation, the email offered a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d section, which consisted of only one question:", "Q. Why would I want to join an inexplicable mob?A. Tons of other people are doing it.", "Watches were to be synchronized against the U.S. government\u2019s atomic clocks, and the email gave instructions for doing so. In order that the mob not form until the appointed time, participants were asked to approach the site from all four cardinal directions, based on birth month: January or July, up Broadway from the south; February or August, down Broadway from the north; etc. At 7:24 P.M. the following Tuesday, June 3, the mob was to converge upon Claire\u2019s Accessories, a small chain store near Astor Place that sells barrettes, scrunchies, and such. The gathering was to last for precisely seven minutes, until 7:31, at which time all would disperse. \u201cNO ONE,\u201d the email cautioned, \u201cSHOULD REMAIN AT THE SITE AFTER 7:33.\u201d", "My subjects were grad students, publishing functionaries, cultured technologists, comedy writers, aspiring poets, musicians, actors, novelists, their ages ranging from the early twenties to the middle thirties. They were, that is to say, a fairly representative crosssection of hipsters, and these were people who did not easily let themselves get left out. I rated the project\u2019s chances as fair to good.", "As it happened, MOB #1 would fail, but on a technicality\u2014apparently the NYPD had been alerted beforehand, and so we arrived to find six officers and a police truck barring entrance to the store.[1] Yet the underlying science seemed sound, and for MOB #2, two weeks later, only minor adjustments were required. I found four ill-frequented bars near the intended site and had the participants gather at those beforehand, again split by the month of their birth. Ten minutes before the appointed time, slips of paper bearing the final destination were distributed at the bars. The site was the Macy\u2019s rug department, where, all at once, two hundred people wandered over to the carpet in the back left corner and, as instructed, informed clerks that they all lived together in a Long Island City commune and were looking for a \u201clove rug.\u201d", "E-MAIL MOB TAKES MANHATTAN, read the headline two days later on Wired News. The successful result was also hailed in blogs, and soon I received emails from San Francisco, Minneapolis, Boston, Austin, announcing their own local chapters. Some asked for advice, which I very gladly gave. (\u201c[B]efore you send out the instructions, visit the spot at the same time and on the same day of the week, and figure out how long it will take people to get to the mob spot,\u201d I told Minneapolis.) One blog proprietor[2] gave the concept a name\u2014\u201dflash mobs\u201d\u2014after a 1973 science-fiction short story, \u201cFlash Crowd,\u201d which deals with the unexpected downside of cheap teleportation technology: packs of thrillseekers who beam themselves in whenever a good time is going down. The story\u2019s protagonist, Jerryberry Jensen, is a TV journalist who inadvertently touches off a multiday riot in a shopping mall, but eventually he clears his name by showing how technology was to blame. Similar claims, as it happens, were soon made about flash mobs, but I myself believe that the technology played only a minor role. The emails went out a week before each event, after all; one could have passed around flyers on the street, I think, to roughly similar effect. What the project harnessed was the joining urge, a drive toward deindividuation easily discernible in the New York hipster population.", "The basic hypothesis behind the Mob Project was as follows: seeing how all culture in New York was demonstrably commingled with scenesterism, the appeal of concerts and plays and readings and gallery shows deriving less from the work itself than from the social opportunities the work might engender, it should theoretically be possible to create an art project consisting of pure scene\u2014meaning the scene would be the entire point of the work, and indeed would itself constitute the work.", "At its best, the Mob Project brought to this task a sort of formal unity, as can be illustrated in MOB #3, which took place fifteen days after #2 and was set in the Grand Hyatt, a hotel fronting on Forty-second Street adjacent to Grand Central Station. Picture a lobby a whole block long sporting well-maintained fixtures in the high Eighties style, gold-chrome railings and sepia-mirror walls and a fountain in marblish stone, with a mezzanine ringed overhead. The time was set for 7:07 P.M., the tail end of the evening rush hour; the train station next door was thick with commuters, as was (visible through the hotel\u2019s tinted-glass facade) the sidewalk outside, but the lobby was nearly empty: only a few besuited types, guests presumably, sunk here and there into armchairs. Starting five minutes beforehand the mob members slipped in, in twos and threes and tens, milling around in the lobby and making stylish small talk.", "Fig. 2\u2014Schematic, MOB #3 in Grand Hyatt Hotel.", "Then all at once, we rode the elevators and escalators up to the mezzanine and wordlessly lined the banister, as depicted in Figure 2. The handful of hotel guests were still there, alone again, except now they were confronted with a hundreds-strong armada of hipsters overhead, arrayed shoulder to shoulder, staring silently down. But intimidation was not the point; we were staring down at where we had just been, and also across at one another, two hundred artist-spectators commandeering an atrium on Forty-second Street as a coliseum-style theater of self-regard. After five minutes of staring, the ring erupted into precisely fifteen seconds of tumultuous applause\u2014 for itself\u2014after which it scattered back downstairs and out the door, just as the police cruisers were rolling up, flashers on.", "phases 2 & 3: propagation and backlash", "I endeavored to devise a media strategy on the project\u2019s own terms. The mob was all about the herd instinct, I reasoned, about the desire not to be left out of the latest fad; logically, then, it should grow as quickly as possible and then\u2014this seemed obvious\u2014buckle under the weight of its own popularity. I developed a single maxim for myself, as custodian of the mob: \u201cAnything that grows the mob is pro-mob.\u201d And in accordance with this principle, I gave interviews to all reporters who asked. In the six weeks following MOB #3, I did perhaps thirty different interviews, not only with local newspapers (the Post and the Daily News, though not yet the Times\u2014more on that later) but also with Time, Time Out New York, the Christian Science Monitor, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Chicago Tribune, the Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse, and countless websites.", "There was also the matter of how I would be identified. My original preference had been to remain entirely anonymous, but I had only half succeeded; at the first, aborted mob, a radio reporter had discovered my first name and broadcast it, and so I was forced to be Bill\u2014or, more often, \u201cBill\u201d\u2014in my dealings with the media thereafter. \u201c[L]ike Cher and Madonna, prefers to use only his first name,\u201d wrote the Chicago Daily Herald. To those who asked my occupation I replied simply that I worked in the \u201cculture industry.\u201d (I was, and still am, an editor at this magazine.)", "Usually a flash-mob story would invoke me roughly three quarters of the way down, as the \u201cshadowy figure\u201d at the center of the project. There were dark questions as to my intentions.[3] \u201cBill, who denies he is on a powertrip, declined to be identified,\u201d intoned Britain\u2019s Daily Mirror. Here is an exchange from Fox News\u2019s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren:", "anchor: Now the guy who came up with the Mob Project is a mystery man named Bill.

The following week, the interview request from the New York Times finally arrived. On the phone the reporter, Amy Harmon, made it clear to me that the Times knew it was behind on the story. They would be remedying this, she told me, by running a prominent piece on flash mobs in their Sunday \u201cWeek in Review\u201d section.", "What the Times did, in fascinating fashion, was not just to run the backlash story (which I had been expecting in three to five more weeks) but to do so preemptively\u2014i.e., before the backlash actually had materialized. Harmon\u2019s piece bore the headline GUESS SOME PEOPLE DON\u2019T HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO, and its nut sentence ran: \u201c[T]he flash mob juggernaut has now run into a flash mob backlash that may be spreading faster than the fad itself.\u201d As evidence, she mustered the following:", "E-mail lists like \u201cantimob\u201d and \u201cslashmob\u201d have sprung up, as did a Web site warning that \u201cflashmuggers\u201d are bound to show up \u201cwherever there\u2019s groups of young, naive, wealthy, bored fashionistas to be found.\u201d And a new definition was circulated last week on several Web sites: \u201cflash mob, noun: An impromptu gathering, organized by means of electronic communication, of the unemployed.\u201d", "Two email lists, a website, and a forwarded definition hardly constituted a \u201cbacklash\u201d against this still-growing, intercontinental fad, but what I think Harmon and the Times rightly understood was that a backlash was the only avenue by which they could advance the story. The competition had soundly beaten the Times already on what, using my taxonomy, one might call the Phases 1 and 2 stories (the experiment and its rapid propagation), and so their thinking progressed naturally to the subsequent phase\u2014i.e., the backlash. It followed inexorably from the subconscious logic of contemporary journalism: just as a popular president requires momentous looking photo spreads in newsweeklies, or as the rise of a new technology requires think-pieces about its threat to the very fabric of civil society, so a fad like the flash mob requires a backlash.[4] Whether through direct causation or mere journalistic intuition, the Times timed its backlash story (8/17/03) with remarkable accuracy (see Figure 3).", "", "I announced that MOB #8, in early September, would be the last. The site was a concrete alcove right on Forty-second Street, just across from the Cond\u00e9 Nast building. Participants had been told to follow the instructions blaring from a cheap boombox I had set up beforehand atop a brick ledge. The cheering of the hundreds grew so great that it drowned out the speakers. The mob had become unmoored. All of a sudden a man in a toque, apparently some sort of opportunistic art shaman, opened his briefcase to reveal a glowing neon sign, and the crowd bent to his will. He held up two fingers and the mob began chanting \u201cPeace!\u201d The project had been hijacked by a figure more charismatic than myself. The stage had been set for Phase 4.", "prior research", "When a British art magazine asked me who, among artists past or present, had most influenced the flash-mob project, I named Stanley Milgram\u2014the social psychologist best known for his authority experiments, in which he induced average Americans to give seemingly fatal shocks to strangers. As it happens, I later discovered that Milgram himself did a project much like a flash mob, in which a \u201cstimulus crowd\u201d of his confederates, varying in number from one to fifteen, stopped on a busy Manhattan sidewalk and all at once looked up to the same sixth-floor window. The results can be seen in Figure 4, a chart from his paper \u201cNote on the Drawing Power of Crowds of Different Size.\u201d", "", "Stanley Milgram deserves recognition, I believe, as one of the crucial artists of the preceding century. Consider his crowd experiment, which, it must be admitted, is fairly thin gruel as science: everyone knows that such an effect would be observed, and what value is there in quantifying it? No, the value of this experiment is entirely in its performance, the unadorned audacity of it, a small crowd in simple unison bucking the city\u2019s flow\u2014a Fluxus-style \u201chappening\u201d but without the blinkered optimism, and in that respect closer, perhaps, to a Ray Johnson \u201cnothing.\u201d Milgram\u2019s crowd study was far less explanatory than it was expressive, serving as an elegant metaphor for conformism while adding little to our scientific understanding of who conforms or why. Other of Milgram\u2019s creations seem more akin to collaborative art. He had Parisians draw \u201cmental maps\u201d of their city that he then himself collated into a consensus work\u2014prefiguring, for example, the contemporary artists Komar and Melamid\u2019s brilliant \u201cfavorite painting\u201d projects of the 1990s. In yet another premonition of Ray Johnson, Milgram also fixated on the mail as a medium; this was chiefly through his famous \u201clost letter\u201d technique, in which dozens of sealed, stamped letters addressed to controversial-sounding organizations (e.g., Equal Rights for Negroes, Friends of the Nazi Party) were left such that they would be found by passersby and mailed (or not) to their destinations. In this manner he even attempted to predict the outcome of the1964 presidential election, leading to a remarkable coup de th\u00e9\u00e2ter in which hundreds of letters in support of each candidate were dropped onto Worcester from a prop plane.", "The Milgramite tradition in art would be defined, I think, by the following premise: that man, whom we now know to respond predictably to social forces, is therefore himself the ultimate artistic medium. This is certainly the primary force of Milgram\u2019s authority experiments: others had done research on conformism and authority, but what set Milgram\u2019s apart was the vertiginousness of the narrative he made out of men. On the faux shock machine itself, with its manufacturer\u2019s label (shock generator, type zlb) from the fictitious \u201cDyson Instrument Company\u201d in Waltham, Mass., was a series of thirty labeled switches, beginning with slight shock and ending with extreme intensity shock, danger: severe shock, and, simply, x x x. This final switch, so ominously marked, was nevertheless quite willingly employed, even after the subject\u2019s screams had subsided into silence. This was what stirred the public\u2014the sheer barbarity of what Milgram had made men do, and how easily he made them do it.", "There is also a virulent counterstrain of this tradition, one that Milgram himself characteristically foresaw: reality television, which seeks to entertain through simple documentary voyeurism. In one of his last published papers before his death, he co-authored an essay on the subject of Candid Camera, which could fairly be called the ur-reality-TV show. His essay was largely and justifiably laudatory\u2014the show \u201cgives us a new vision through the disruption of the habitual,\u201d he wrote, in a neat summation of the Milgramite aesthetic. And yet: \u201cAbove all, Candid Camera is a commercial activity. The overriding goal of the producer is to create materials that can be sold to a network or a sponsor.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The scientific\u201d\u2014and here we may as well substitute artistic\u2014\u201ddeficiencies of the Candid Camera material stem from its origin as commercial entertainment.\u201d", "His most telling example of such deficiencies is in the way the show is managed down to a simple, digestible narrative message\u2014in Candid Camera\u2018s case, for laughs, but the point could have been as easily applied to the cheap drama of The Apprentice or the luridity of Trading Spouses. \u201c[T]he viewer is instructed by the narrator about exactly what to look for; his comments reinforce the notion that what we are about to see will be funny,\u201d Milgram wrote. \u201cStudio laughter accompanies each episode as a way of continually defining the actions as funny, prompting the home viewer to experience the scene as amusing, rather than feeling sympathy or compassion for the victim\u2019s plight, or searching to understand it.\u201d It is precisely here that we who would make Milgramite art must keep vigilant: in resisting simple story lines and embracing, instead, the ambiguities in our data.", "phase 4: co-optation", "To the many demerits of City Hall Plaza in Boston I can add this: it is a singularly poor spot to hold a flash mob. It is as if the space were calibrated to render futile any gathering, large or small, attempted anywhere on its arid expanse. All the nearby buildings seem to be facing away, making the plaza\u2019s eleven acres of concrete and brick feel like the world\u2019s largest back alley. There is no nearby community to speak of, the historic neighborhood there\u2014the old Scully Square, a convivial knot of tightly packed apartment houses and popular burlesque theaters\u2014having been entirely razed in the early 1960s. In its stead was laid down a plaza so devoid of benches, greenery, and other signposts of human hospitality that even on the loveliest fall weekend, when the Common and Esplanade and other public spaces teem with Bostonians at leisure, the plaza stands utterly empty save for the occasional skateboarder grinding a lonely path across its long, shallow steps to nowhere. The Hall itself, hailed at its construction as a paragon of what then was approvingly called the \u201cNew Brutalist\u201d movement, approximates both the shape and the charm of an offshore oil platform; its concrete facade is now pocked with spalls and dulled by weeping dark patches of smut.", "I had traveled to Boston last summer to observe a \u201cFusion Flash Concert\u201d\u2014a marketing campaign I had first learned of two weeks earlier, through a Financial Times column emailed to me by a friend. A \u201cseries of flash mobbing events,\u201d the FT had reported, was \u201cbeing staged by Ford Motor with Sony Pictures Digital to promote the launch of the new Ford Fusion car.\u201d Weren\u2019t you always concerned about this? _my friend had written in the subject heading. I had never been concerned about it but rather had expected and even welcomed it, since co-optation of the flash mob by the nation\u2019s large conglomerates would, I reasoned, be its final (and fatal) phase. Up to this point, the only sign of co-optation so far had been a 2004 episode of _CSI: Miami, one of the five-top-rated television shows in the nation, that centered around a flash mob. Entitled \u201cMurder in a Flash,\u201d the episode begins with a flash mob that leaves a dead body in its aftermath, but by the end\u2014and here is where the writers really earn their residuals\u2014we learn that the stiff had been there already, the mob sent later by an honest teen to clue police in to the deed.", "That had been a mere reference to flash mobs, whereas Fusion Flash Concerts was a true co-optation: Ford was itself appropriating the trend, and was doing so in order to make a product seem cool.[5] By presenting myself as an interested member of the news media, I was able to confirm this latter point with Ford directly. Ford was, a spokesman told me by phone, \u201clooking for cool ways to connect with their target audience,\u201d at both a \u201cprice point\u201d and what he called a \u201ccool point.\u201d The flash concerts idea, he said, had \u201ca spontaneity and a cool factor that was attached to it.\u201d", "He invited me to come and see a flash concert for myself, and of course I agreed. The featured act would be a band called Staind, whose upcoming album Rolling Stone had described as \u201ca unique combo of AA-meeting ballads and fetal-position metal.\u201d Most concertgoers would have to register at the site and wait to receive the details just beforehand, but to a reporter in good standing he was willing to reveal the secret show date. It was a week and a half away, in early August\u2014the same date, as a matter of fact, that Staind\u2019s new album was to be released.", "Wandering the site two hours before showtime, I was struck by how every vestige of \u201cflash\u201d had already been stripped from the evening\u2019s event. The \u201clast-minute\u201d emails had in fact gone out six days beforehand. Two radio stations had been tapped to promote the show with ads (\u201cjust to pump everything up,\u201d another Ford rep had told me). Newspapers had listed the concert in their daily arts calendars. Here at City Hall Plaza a tremendous soundstage had already been erected, its prodigious backdrop displaying the cover art from Staind\u2019s new album. Phalanxes of motorbike cops rumbled around, eyeing the hundred-strong klatch of diehard Stainders lumped directly before the empty stage. Ford had already set up a hospitality tent, had cordoned off a VIP area, and, atop yard-high stands in the near distance, had perched two new Ford Fusions, the eponymous guests of honor, tilted widthwise as if banking gnarly turns.", "While we waited for the sound check, Barry Grant, a Ford rep, offered to show me around the product. Barry was a sunny fellow whose face had a pleasingly Mephistophelian aspect, with a neat goatee and a shaved head atop which unnecessary sunglasses were perched. I knew that recent years had not been kind to Ford; its auto operations were losing nearly a billion dollars a quarter, and in May its bonds were reclassified as junk. Its stock price was down by a third since the beginning of the year, and soon (during the course of the Fusion Flash Concerts series) it would drop by even more.", "As Barry and I cut through the crowd toward the Fusions, I asked him in very general terms who Ford thought the car\u2019s ideal customer was likely to be. As it turns out, he said, the company had done a great deal of \u201cpsychographic profiling\u201d on just this question.", "\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at here is someone who\u2019s moving ahead in their lives, they\u2019re moving forward in their career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a person who\u2019s entrepreneurial, thinking outside the box. They\u2019re generally young, they\u2019re either in a relationship now or are getting married sometime soon, and they\u2019re into activities like music, technology, exercise.\u201d", "Really, I reflected, he was describing no one so much as myself, whose own marriage was then only six weeks away and who was, at least at that moment, in possession of a gym membership.[6]", "\u201cSee the contrast stitching, and the nice chrome accents and details, the piano-black finish\u2014all for less than twenty and a half.\u201d Barry gestured through the window at the dash. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how this vehicle looks, how it feels, how it moves, you know?\u201d He delivered his final judgment with genuine awe: \u201cI think we\u2019ve hit on all the senses with this one.\u201d", "As we talked, a roadie onstage had begun to test the drums individually. With each stroke a deafening clap shot out across the plaza, caromed off a Brutalist wall, and rebounded past us again, barely diminished. I looked around at the crowd, the average age of which was perhaps nineteen, a motley collection of wan goth girls, leathery semidrifters, wiry North Shore bullies in wifebeaters. A bleach blonde wandered by in a tight T-shirt reading no bar\u2019s too far. I remarked to Barry that, psychographically speaking, the crowd did not seem to be what he and Ford had in mind.", "It was true, Barry acknowledged, that the Fusion was \u201creally going for people who are mid-twenties to, say, late thirties,\u201d but he added, \u201cWe know the vehicle has youth appeal . . . . This vehicle, it kind of shakes things up a little bit. I mean, look at the black one\u2014I think it looks a little bit different from an Accord or Camry.\u201d His tone implied severe understatement.", "I looked at the black one. In point of fact, the vehicle shook nothing up. Its design was supremely generic, as if an Accord, a Camry, and every other sedan on the market had been meticulously averaged together. I could safely say that no one present at this concert hoped ever to have to buy this car. A word began to hover in my mind with respect to the Fusion Flash Concerts program, and that word was desperation.", "", "subject population", "Boston\u2019s first flash mob, in July of 2003, had been entitled \u201cOde to Bill.\u201d In it, hundreds had packed the greeting-card aisles of a Harvard Square department store, telling bystanders who inquired that they were looking for a card for their friend Bill in New York. Although the gesture was rendered somewhat hollow by the fact that I failed to receive a single card, I nevertheless approved of Boston\u2019s mob on strictly artistic grounds. Nothing is more defining of hipsterism than semi-ironic coronation of its own celebrities, and by making a half-hearted, jesting attempt to elevate me to celebrity status, Boston had given its mob an appropriately sly turn.", "Although the field of hipster celebrities is constantly changing, I have attempted a partial version of the current schema in Figure 5. This phenomenon is, I think, a simple corollary of the drive toward deindividuation as postulated above. I made explicit reference to this in MOB #7, where participants were instructed to materialize suddenly as an immense single-file line leading from a disused door on the side of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. The line, which would eventually stretch a quarter-mile around the entire block-sized church, was to be unaccountably present for precisely five minutes; and if, during this time, a bypasser asked the mobbers what they were lining up for, they were to respond that they \u201cheard they\u2019re selling Strokes tickets.\u201d The Strokes were a then-popular rock band among the hipsters.", "", "Almost all of the mobs I organized had been, in some sense, jokes on the subject of conformity. MOB #4 pretended to be a tour group from Maryland (my home state) so excited to be in a New York shoe store that they had to pull out their cell phones and tell their friends about it. There was #6, with the genuflecting in the corporate toy store, and then #8, of course, where in essence the mob followed orders made by speakers on a pole\u2014nothing more straightforward than that, I thought. In #7, though, my point was sharpened somewhat, in that the mob was enacting obedience not just in some generic sense but in specific reference to hipster culture, so that the self-ridicule was made explicit. I was pointing out that hipsters, our supposed cultural avant-garde, are in fact a transcontinental society of cultural receptors, straining to perceive which shifts to follow. I must hasten to add that this is not entirely their fault: the Internet can propagate any flashy notion, whether it be a style of eyewear or a presidential candidacy, with such instantaneity that a convergence on the \u201chip\u201d tends now to happen unself-consciously, as a simple matter of course.", "But hipsters, after becoming aware of this very dynamic, have responded in a curious and counterintuitive way. Even as they might decry this drive toward unanimity, they continually embrace it and re-embrace it in an enthusiastic, almost ecstatic fashion. No phenomenon of recent years illustrated this point as clearly as the aforementioned Strokes, who for most of 2002 held the top-band spot in hipsterdom. This was a band that, albeit enjoyable and skilled, had been clearly manufactured precisely for hipster delectation. Moreover, the hipsters were well aware of this fact, and they complained about it incessantly even as they cued up the record at parties and danced with special abandon. Indeed, one could perceive something palpably different, something animal, in the hipster species when the Strokes came over the speakers; and it was, I think, the reckless, self-abnegating joy of this simple unanimity, of oneness for its own sake. The Strokes made a natural object of this unanimity because their sound\u2014derivative candy, 1970s punk simplicity dressed up with some 1990s indie-rock aloofness\u2014was an easy common denominator. They were no Pixies, no Fugazi, no Joy Division, no band to which pledging allegiance implied the endorsement of a principle. They were, moreover, easily discarded, and the top-band mantle has been passed many times since then, in rapid succession\u2014to equally derivative groups possessing the required sheen of sophistication, such as Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, Bloc Party, and, as of this writing, an outfit called Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.", "Popular music, perhaps, has always been a fickle thing. So let us turn to literature. The most significant literary movement the hipsters have produced is McSweeney\u2019s, which itself had essentially the characteristics of a pop-music fad. Soon after Dave Eggers started the journal/website/publishing house in Brooklyn, its writers became not just sought-after publishing prospects but also minor celebrities whose readings across the country soon overflowed with devotees. The style of these readings, which blended attempts at semiserious prose with comedic flourishes and live music, was itself widely mimicked. (If you have ever been forced at a reading to watch Rick Moody play guitar, you have McSweeney\u2019s to blame.) Its minimalist graphic design, sometimes down even to its Garamond typeface, was fast borrowed by publications ranging from webzines to major book houses. And its elliptical prose stylings were duly parroted by what seemed at times to be an entire generation of writers.[7]", "Like the Strokes, McSweeney\u2019s promised a cultural watershed for hipsters while making no demands on them. Readers accustomed to a choice between low entertainment and serious literature did not, with this journal, have to make such a choice at all. And for would-be writers, buckling under the weight of the literary task, McSweeney\u2019s mapped out an easier and far more pleasurable route. In its pages literature appeared as a sort of pot-luck barbecue where the young litterateur, merely by whipping up some absurdist trifle or other, could throw the Frisbee with established authors who were publishing their castoffs there. Almost none of the young writers could deploy McSweeney\u2019s style to anywhere near the effect that Eggers, a genuinely affecting writer, could; one suspects that most would have been better (if less well known) writers today if the journal had never existed.", "Inevitably, even as McSweeney\u2019s has matured and gained more seriousness of purpose, it has receded in hipster esteem, just as did trucker hats, Hush Puppies, the mullet. Like starlings on a trash-strewn field the hipsters alight together, peck intently for a time, and at some indiscernible signal take wing again at once. If they are the American avant-garde it is true, I think, in only this aspect\u2014the unending churn of their tastes, this adult faddishness in the adolescent style.", "propagation tool: the blog", "While waiting for the sound check, I was given the opportunity to chat with Howie Cockrill, who wrote the official weblog on the Fusion Flash Concerts website. I had very much hoped to meet Howie and had familiarized myself with his work beforehand, because I hoped to make further study of the blog\u2019s utility as a propagation device. The role that blogs had played in the spread of flash mobs came very much as a surprise to me; at the time, I had thought word of the mobs would spread through forwarded emails alone, so that the mobs themselves would be cross-sections of an unbroken network of acquaintanceship\u2014i.e., any mob attendee would sit at the end of an email chain that stretched back directly, if distantly, to myself. I refused to put up a website for the project, or to reveal the project\u2019s email address to reporters who had not yet learned it, in order that the mob would be made only by this sort of direct person-to-person contact, extended out exponentially. Each person who forwarded the email was, in my view, taking on the project as their own; in enlisting his or her own social network each was as responsible for the mob, earned as much praise or blame for it, as I.", "Yet when people had begun to ask if they might post the mob emails on their blogs, I concluded that the answer should be yes. It is true that blogs, like all websites, are inherently undirected, in that anyone can navigate to them as he or she pleases, and this was definitely a concern: I did not want anyone to learn the mob details without making human contact with another mob member. But blogs are by their nature such intimate endeavors that even the most widely read among them seem to foster a sense of close connectedness among their readers. This stems, perhaps, from their inherently arcane content\u2014i.e., the blogger\u2019s ceaseless mental minutiae, of which any avid reader will be a truly compatible soul. A mob spread partly by blogs was still, as I had intended, a virtual community made physical.", "Howie\u2019s Fusion Flash Concerts blog, though, was a somewhat more complicated case. He normally wrote on a group blog called \u201cCrazy Talk,\u201d where he offered such comments as the following:", "[W]hen bands start to get noticed, all sorts of people come out of the woodwork with contracts & pens, looking to \u201chelp their career\u201d\u2014record labels, managers, publicists, publishers, producers, distributors, accounting firms and let\u2019s not forget lawyers. . . . [M]ost artists live completely in the dark about the terms of the contracts they sign, the money coming in and going out, their obligations to the different parties they sign on with and vice versa. . . . [M]usicians are so fucked its not even funny.", "But on the Fusion Flash Concerts blog, one encountered a different Howie:", "I\u2019m out of breath from typing so much, but there\u2019s just so much to say! So here\u2019s the details for the next flash concert: JERMAINE DUPRI will hit the stage @ 8 PM @ CENTENNIAL PARK in Downtown Atlanta! (Doors open at 6:30 PM). You think its hot in Atlanta now\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. .just wait \u2019til tomorrow night!", "Or:", "The Jermaine Dupri show in Atlanta was just plain nuts! His So So Def crew stirred it up good, and the crowd got down so hard that it rained.", "Now its time to pass the torch for the next flash concert!", "When I met Howie, I brought up this issue of tone and found him admirably self-aware on the subject. He called his posts \u201cexperiential reviews,\u201d by which he meant \u201cnot, this is what I think of the band, or this is what I think of how the show went, but this is what the audience thought of the show.\u201d He made his point a little more explicit: \u201cI try to infuse a little bit of hyperbole into it. Make it a little bit of a short story, you know what I mean?\u201d In order to chat, he and I had retreated from the din of the crowd into the Plaza\u2019s modernist tundra. Howie is an affable Arkansan with half-tinted glasses and a full but well-maintained blond beard; when not blogging he was a law student at the University of San Francisco, and had been set up with the gig, which he called \u201cthe most sweet summer job of all time,\u201d by a friend who worked at Sony. On the subject of Staind, Howie was noncommittal, but he added: \u201cIt\u2019s popular for a reason, I guess\u2014you know? And that\u2019s sort of what I have to tap into when I write the reviews. These people obviously love Staind, and there\u2019s a reason that they love Staind.\u201d", "The sound check finally went on at nearly 6:30, and afterward I returned to the media desk to wait for the show. A giant Ford rep with a graying goatee asked me about my story. I was writing about what happened to flash mobs, I told him.", "He looked at me intensely. \u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d I thought I heard him say.", "I stared back at him. Here, finally, was a Ford rep willing to throw down.", "\u201cThe Dead,\u201d he said again. \u201cThey\u2019d do concerts like this. And raves. Flash concerts are pretty much like raves.\u201d I could barely hide my disappointment at this turn. We looked out at the restless crowd of \u201cflash mobbers\u201d packing up against the stage, their boredom having prompted them to throw a hailstorm of increasingly dangerous material into the air: balloons, then empty water bottles, then full water bottles, then aluminum cans. Sporadic fistfights had begun to break out.", "The Ford rep shook his head at the scene and smiled. \u201cEverybody wants to feel like an insider,\u201d he said.", "social ramifications: howard dean and \u201cthe perfect storm\u201d", "In the media coverage of flash mobs, the most curious undercurrent was the notion, almost a wish, that they would someday become something serious. A very smart person named Howard Rheingold happened a year before the fad to have published a book called Smart Mobs, about the phenomenal social ramifications of mobile-phone and other miniaturized computing technologies\u2014ideas that the \u201cflash mob\u201d frankly seemed a nihilistic perversion of, but Rheingold let himself be drawn into the media scrum nevertheless. Without fail it became his role to supply a quote alleging that this completely puerile fad was in fact a harbinger of something important. \u201c[A] symptom of a phenomenon that has a long-term and large-scale effect,\u201d said Rheingold tactfully in the Dallas Morning News, which also referred to him as a \u201cfuturist\u201d; \u201cearly signs of something that\u2019s going to grow much bigger,\u201d he said in the Christian Science Monitor.", "Bloggers tended to share this vision, and as the Mob Project persisted in its absurdism they began to chafe. Even those who did not want the mobs to espouse explicit politics nevertheless hoped they might begin to demonstrate in some way to the surrounding spectators. For example, MOB #6, in the Times Square Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, was the largest and arguably most successful of all the mobs, but almost unanimously the bloggers panned it. \u201cAnother Mob Botched,\u201d was the verdict on the blog Fancy Robot: \u201c[I]nstead of setting the Flash Mob out in public on Times Square itself, as everyone had hoped, The Flash Master decided to set it in Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, with apparently dismal results.\u201d SatansLaundromat.com (a photo-blog that contains the most complete visual record of the New York project) concurred\u2014\u201cnot public enough,\u201d the blogger wrote, without enough \u201cspectators to bewilder.\u201d Chris from the CCE Blog wrote: \u201cI think the common feeling among these blogger reviews is: where does the idea go from here? . . . After seeing hundreds of people show up for no good reason, it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s some kind of potential for artistic or political expression here.\u201d", "The idea seemed to be that flash mobs could be made to convey a message, but for a number of reasons this dream was destined to run aground. First, as outlined above, flash mobs were gatherings of insiders, and as such could hardly communicate to those who did not already belong. They were intramural play; they drew their energies not from impressing outsiders or freaking them out but from showing them utter disregard, from using the outside world as merely a terrain for private games. Second, flash mobs were by definition transitory, ten minutes or less, and thereby not exactly suited to standing their ground and testifying. Third, in terms of physical space, flash mobs relied on constraints to create an illusion of superior strength. I never held mobs in the open, the bloggers complained, in view of enough onlookers, but this was entirely purposeful on my part, for like Colin Powell I hewed to the doctrine of overwhelming force. Only in enclosed spaces could the mob generate the necessary self-awe; to allow the mob to feel small would have been to destroy it.[8]", "Four months after the final New York flash mob, there was a series of gatherings in Iowa whose dismal outcome supported my theory on these points. Those gatherings were the \u201cPerfect Storm,\u201d four weekend-long pushes by the Howard Dean campaign in Iowa in advance of that state\u2019s January 19 caucus. In keeping with their name (which, like \u201cflash mob,\u201d employed a properly meteorological metaphor), the Perfect Storm weekends brought in 3,500 out-of-state Dean supporters to walk door to door and stump for their man. The volunteer headquarters occupied an entire city block; the out-of-town storm troopers all wore matching orange stocking caps, precisely to accentuate their number, to flaunt their ubiquity. They were, like a flash mob, a virtual community made physical, in that the great preponderance of the members had developed their relationship with the campaign online.[9] Indeed, Dean\u2019s klatch of cybergurus had come to envision the entire campaign as a form of \u201csocial software,\u201d in which supporters dwelled in a virtual locale called \u201cDeanSpace.\u201d When Wired magazine asked one of these gurus (a tech entrepreneur named Joi Ito) how these online masses would be led, he replied, \u201cYou\u2019re not a leader, you\u2019re a place. You\u2019re like a park or garden. If it\u2019s comfortable and cool, people are attracted. Deanspace is not really about Dean. It\u2019s about us.\u201d", "That is: just like flash mobs, the Dean campaign was also pure scene, the appeal having become less about the candidate than about his chat rooms, and about how connected one felt inside his youthful and seemingly numberless throng. To allow the Dean campaign to feel small\u2014outnumbered, embattled\u2014was to destroy it; and during those four weeks in Iowa, as the orange-hatted 3,500 dissipated out into the frozen plains, spilling out their passion to the politically benumbed, the candidate\u2019s chances collapsed (see Figure 6).", "Fig. 6\u2014Dean", "", "experimental effect on subjects", "There was, however, one successful element of politics in the flash mob\u2014a vague and dark thing, a purely chaotic impulse that (surprisingly enough, for a fad born of the Internet) was tinged almost with Luddism. It could best be seen at the very moment that a mob came together: a sort of fundamental joy at seeing society overtaken, order stymied; at silently infiltrating this pseudopublic space, this corporate space, these chain stores and shopping malls, and then rising at once to overrun them.", "The acme of this feeling was (ironically, given its subsequent panning on just these grounds) MOB #6, which for a few beautiful minutes stifled what has to be the most ostentatious chain store in the entire city: the Times Square Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, whose excesses are too many to catalogue here but include, in the store\u2019s foyer, an actual operational Ferris wheel some sixty feet in diameter. Up until the appointed time of 7:18 P.M. the mobbers loitered on the upper level, among the GI Joes and the Nintendos and up inside the glittering pink of the two-floor Barbie palace. But then all at once the mob, five hundred strong, crowded around the floor\u2019s centerpiece, a life-size animatronic Tyrannosaurus rex that growls and feints with a Hollywood-class lifelikeness. \u201cFill in all around it,\u201d the mob slip had instructed. \u201cIt is like a terrible god to you.\u201d", "Two minutes later, the mob dropped to its knees, moaning and cowering at the beast behind outstretched hands; in doing so we repaid this spectacle, which clearly was the product of not only untold expenditure but many man-months of imagineering, with an en-masse enactment of the very emotions\u2014visceral fright and infantile fealty\u2014that it obviously had been designed to evoke. MOB #6 was, as many bloggers pointed out pejoratively, \u201ccute,\u201d but the cuteness had been massed, refracted, and focused to such a bright point that it became a physical menace. For six minutes the upper level was paralyzed; the cash registers were cocooned behind the moaning, kneeling bodies pressed together; customers were trapped; business could not be done. The terror-stricken store personnel tried in vain to force the crowd out. \u201cIs anyone making a purchase?\u201d one was heard to call out, weakly. As the mob dispersed down the escalators and out into the street, the police arrived downstairs, telling us to leave, but we had already accomplished the task, had delivered what was in effect a warning.", "Did these dark impulses remain with the participants, I wondered, or did they dissipate with the mob? This question, as it happens, also troubled Stanley Milgram long after his authority experiments were complete; he was bedeviled his entire life by critics who claimed he had permanently changed his subjects, had in fact victimized them. One such critic, the Welsh poet Dannie Abse, wrote a play entitled The Dogs of Pavlov that was loosely based on Milgram\u2019s authority experiments. Before its publication as a book, he sent his introduction, which was directly critical of Milgram, to the professor himself for comment.", "In the subsequent exchange, Milgram relates the story of a young man who had been through the study in 1964 and six years later sent a letter to Milgram telling him that, as a result, he was seeking CO status to avoid fighting in Vietnam.", "He was going to be sent by our government to Southeast Asia to drop napalm on innocent villagers, to despoil the land, to massacre. He informs me, as many others have done, that the experiment has deepened his understanding of the moral problems of submitting to malevolent authority. He has learned something. He takes a stand. He becomes a conscientious objector. Has he been victimized by the experiment, or has he been liberated by it?", "In the same letter, Milgram offers Abse a rationale for the experiments that is stunning in its utter lack of scientific disinterest:", "The obedience experiment is not a study in which the subject is treated as a passive object, acted upon without any possibility of controlling his own experience. Indeed the entire experimental situation has been created to allow the subject to exercise a human choice, and thus express his nature as a person.", "Was this not what flash mobs could have done, in some purer and more ideal form? I had meant them as an authority experiment, in the Milgramite style, but was not their promise instead to have been the mirror image\u2014an anti-authority experiment,This is precisely what the Nuclear Option is intended to be. When first hearing about the project, each person is presented with a private choice: to join the list and thereby become an insider, privy to the details in advance, or else to face being left out. Even strident opponents, I expect, would reason their way toward joining the list\u2014to monitor its activities, for example, or to wage a counterdemonstration on the appointed day\u2014and thus contribute to its growth. Similarly, once the numerical threshold is crossed and the world awakens to find the Nuclear communiqu\u00e9 in its inbox, each of us will again be faced with a choice: to stay inside, stick to the day\u2019s agenda items as laid out in the planner, or watch as civic order is cut off at the knees. Could a society of spectators resist bearing witness to its own undoing?a play at revolution, an acting-out of the human choice to thwart order?", "", "conclusion", "I myself left the \u201cflash concert\u201d ten minutes after it began: the maximum length of a flash mob. I remained, to my own surprise, a flash-mob purist, even though the day\u2019s event had abandoned every precept of the original idea. For the subway ride back to my car I had bought the day\u2019s Globe, and prominent in the Arts section I found a story about the evening\u2019s show.", "It began: The \u201cflash mob\u201d concept where people gather on short notice after contacting each other through e-mails and text messages has come to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.

Ford and Sony did not care to steal the concept, or even to sap its essence. To place stories like this, they needed only to take the term, even if in so doing they stripped it entirely of its meaning. Ford and Sony had managed to take my fad, an empty meditation on emptiness, and to render it even more vacuous.

Instead, I find one woman standing by herself, wearing the millennial version of a Flashdance ensemble: curly bangs, wide-legged pants, a cropped gray sweatshirt. She waves me over with a smile. \u201cAre you here for The OA?\u201d she asks brightly. \u201cWe\u2019re practicing down the street. Come with me.\u201d", "The woman\u2019s name, I soon learn, is Jess Grippo. She\u2019s responsible \u2014 along with friends Ashley Williams and Eduardo Pacer \u2014 for organizing the flash mob that\u2019s about to go down in front of Netflix HQ, as well as the one an hour later in Times Square. On a purely surface level, the point of the flash mob, the latest action by the #SavetheOA movement, is to convince Netflix to renew Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij\u2019s supernatural TV series, starring Marling as a missing blind woman who reappears seven years later with her vision restored. But it quickly becomes clear that the gathering is more about a sort of collective catharsis, a way for likeminded people to come together and find connection inside the cold-sweat grip of late capitalism.", "This isn\u2019t Grippo\u2019s first OA-centric dance mob. A former ballerina, she tells me she began watching The OA in 2017 after Trump\u2019s election, and was instantly transfixed by \u201cthe idea that movement is healing and powerful \u2014 it reminds us that we need art to keep us going, especially in these crazy times.\u201d A few weeks later, she and Williams and Pacer planned a flash mob in front of Trump Tower, where they reenacted what\u2019s known on the show as the \u201cmovements,\u201d in an effort to propel him into another dimension. It didn\u2019t work (I think).", "On The OA, the movements transport the protagonists across time and space, but only when done in unison and with \u201cperfect feeling.\u201d They represent blind faith, community, and a willingness to be open and vulnerable. On their own, they are a bit difficult to swallow (at first). They\u2019re unnatural and odd. There\u2019s nothing sexy about them. One movement involves putting your hands in front of your mouth like a bird beak; another is a sort of fake stomach stab paired with a hard exhale. But in the context of the show \u2014 and the flash mob \u2014 the embarrassment is part of the point.", "And for a certain subset of people, they are contagious and thrilling. Before Grippo and I can head to the park, we\u2019re stopped by an older woman and her teenage daughter. \u201cIs this the OA flashmob?\u201d she asks. \u201cI\u2019m so excited. Can I take a picture?\u201d Grippo gamely poses for a photo, pulling me into it. I ask the woman why she\u2019s here. \u201cI can\u2019t do the movements, but I really wanted to see them,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter told me, \u2018Watch this show mom, you\u2019re gonna love it.\u2019 I watched it earlier this year and I just fell in love.\u201d", "The woman and her daughter, camera in hand, follow us to the park, where Grippo is greeted by two dozen or so people with applause and hugs. The group rehearses the movements several times. It\u2019s imperfect, with some slip-ups and loss of synchronicity, but I find myself getting choked up. I\u2019ve written about the show\u2019s rare hopefulness before, but there\u2019s something even more baldly hopeful about watching a group of strangers \u2014 ranging widely in age and race and gender \u2014 come together and risk looking slightly ridiculous in public, all because they love a piece of art so much. It\u2019s one of the least cynical things I\u2019ve ever seen.", "Across the country, on the corner of Sunset and Van Ness, there\u2019s another uncynical movement unfolding. Emperial Young has been standing outside of Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters since August 16, and hunger-striking since early last week, partly in an effort to convince Netflix to release the rights of The OA back to its creators. But the protest isn\u2019t just about The OA, as Young explained in a long, five-part thread on Twitter, where she goes by @emverse. The show\u2019s cancellation, she says, is symptomatic of much larger problems: capitalism, greed, the lack of access to mental-health services, and individualism, among other things.", "For Young, who\u2019s been supported and trashed online in equal measure, the absurdity of her gesture is the point. \u201cTo all the people thinking it is absurd to hunger strike over a TV show: I agree. But you want to know something even more absurd?\u201d she writes. \u201cTens of thousands of people die in the United States every year because they \u2026 cannot afford services to treat mental health issues and medical conditions. Untreated conditions make it harder to obtain employment, making it even more impossible to get help. It\u2019s a capitalist cycle, because in capitalism, an individual who cannot contribute to the system has little to no value.\u201d", "That last part is of particular significance to Young. When I call her on Monday night, she\u2019s been standing on the corner all day, holding a handmade sign. I can hear honks of support in the background. She tells me that while she isn\u2019t necessarily a die-hard fan of The OA, she loves the show\u2019s messages of collectivism and sincerity. \u201cWhen I\u2019m having issues, and I try to reach out and get support, I can\u2019t get anything,\u201d she says. \u201cYou leave messages, people don\u2019t call you back. But when things are difficult, you can turn to art. It makes a difference to people who don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d", "Young says she\u2019s feeling \u201cgreat,\u201d despite having eaten nothing for seven days, bolstered by a recent visit from Marling and Zal, who ran out of their car at a red light on her second day of protesting and offered her food and water. \u201cI got a bit starstruck,\u201d says Young. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know how to process it. I could barely speak. They seemed friendly and open and wonderful.\u201d Marling later posted about the interaction on her social media channels, ruminating on themes similar to Young\u2019s protest: \u201cThe more news I take in of the world, the more I often feel terrifyingly certain that we are on the brink of moral and ecological collapse \u2026 No one is coming to the rescue. We have to save each other. Every day, in small and great ways.\u201d", "Back in New York, the flash mob is getting ready to approach Netflix. The building is under construction, so they gather across the street instead. I ask a woman wearing a blue dress with hearts why she\u2019s there. \u201cI was in the first one, and it was so much fun to dance with people that are likeminded,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cBrit Marling\u2019s character reminds me of myself in a lot of ways. I\u2019m legally blind, so I have a lot of similar childhood memories.\u201d She says she\u2019s here today because \u201cI think we can make things happen with our hearts. That\u2019s why I\u2019m wearing the hearts.\u201d", "Most of the flash-mob participants already know each other from Reddit and Discord, or sites like TheOAIsReal.com, where they\u2019ve been speaking for weeks, sharing personal stories and coming up with creative ways to reach Netflix. Among the thousands connecting: a Brazilian ex-nun; a former CEO turned live-streamer; a queer, single Christian mother; an immigration lawyer for the U.S. government; a Hong Kong protestor; a Turkish farmer; a Mexican-American film editor; a bipolar, formerly suicidal Texan teen; and a Scottish philosopher. They\u2019ve also used the channels to plan good deeds in the spirit of The OA, like cleaning up local parks and highways and fundraising for the Amazon rainforest fire.", "One 19-year-old woman tells me that she loves the show because \u201cit speaks to issues that a lot of us have dealt with. Trauma, emotional repression, and letting go. It runs the human emotional spectrum. If you\u2019re paying attention, it\u2019s hard not to feel really emotional.\u201d Her friend, who she\u2019d previously only met online, chimes in. \u201cWhat if we came together? That can be really healing for a lot of people.\u201d The group plans on continuing their efforts long-term. \u201cWe\u2019re still figuring out exactly what we want to do long-term, but we want to do something bigger,\u201d says the 19-year-old.", "When it\u2019s time for the official performance to start, a hush settles over the dancers. Everyone takes their places, and Grippo stomps her feet three times to signify the beginning of the movements. The group repeats the sequence three times, each with just as much feeling; the whole thing lasts only a few minutes, but it\u2019s palpably sweet and heartfelt, the gentlest and least-inconveniencing protest of all time. Next to me, a young woman films the performance with tears in her eyes. She turns to me. \u201cNot to be weird,\u201d she says, \u201cBut it\u2019s like a net that catches people that it\u2019s meant for. Not everyone\u2019s gonna get it. But the people that do, it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d", "The mob begins its journey to Times Square, where they\u2019ve recently erected a billboard for their cause via a GoFundMe. I post a video of their performance on Twitter, naively thinking that most people will find the whole thing as sweet and charming as I do. Instead, within minutes, a series of hateful comments start rolling in: \u201cEvery day I hate people more.\u201d \u201cWho let these nerds out of their lockers?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure some blind people loved Hitler, too, that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t suck.\u201d", "I open my DMs, where I have a message from one of The OA\u2019s writers, Claire Kiechel, whom I\u2019ve been communicating with over the past few weeks, and who\u2019s been entrenched in the #SavetheOA campaign. She politely asks me to take down the video. \u201cMy OA kids are getting bullied,\u201d she says. I oblige, and ask her why she thinks the video garnered such a strong negative reaction. \u201cIt reminds me of how people reacted to the ending of the first season of The OA,\u201d she writes, referring to the controversial finale, wherein the OA and her cohorts help avert a school shooting by distracting the shooter with the movements. \u201c Many people claimed their anger was about depicting a school shooting, but I think it hit something much deeper. We\u2019re so used to violence in our media that I think the anger was about not seeing a typical school shooting. In Hollywood\u2019s vision of the world, violence should be met with violence. Our automatic response: \u2018That would never work in real life.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cTrue,\u201d she continues. \u201cThis is a fantasy, like all media is. The OA just puts forth a different kind of fantasy.\u201d", "Already a subscriber?\nLog in or link your magazine subscription", "Already a subscriber?\nLog in or link your magazine subscription", "Already a subscriber?\nLog in or link your magazine subscription", "Already a subscriber?\nLog in or link your magazine subscription", "Already a subscriber?\nLog in or link your magazine subscription"]]}
