Whether it\u2019s an off-camber obstacle that\u2019s left a tire or two spinning uselessly in the air or a childlike gravitation toward whatever sloppy, muddy terrain you can find (which is what happened to me\u00a0in the photo above), physics and the limitations of friction will get you at some point. Be prepared with the right equipment or, at the very least, the knowledge of what around you can help free your stuck rig.", "(Photo:  Campofant/iStock)", "In a pinch, sometimes sticks and brush can be the best (read: absolutely free) method for getting moving again. To understand how exactly to do this, it helps to have an idea of how axles and differentials work together to move a vehicle down the road. Most daily-driver cars and trucks come with open differentials that allow wheels on the same axle to travel at different speeds, which is necessary since the wheel on the outside of a turn needs to travel farther and faster than the wheel on the inside. This is great for on-road driving, when all four tires are firmly planted on the pavement, but an unfortunate byproduct of this design is lost forward momentum any time one wheel is in the air, as the open differential will send power to whichever wheel is slipping the most. If a wheel is spinning, the way to get it to stop\u2014thus forcing the truck to send power to the planted wheel\u2014is to give the spinning wheel something to grab onto. If you\u2019re caught in this scenario out in the desert with no recovery equipment, you can usually get the job done by gathering sticks, brush, rocks, or whatever you can find, and jamming them under that traction-less wheel until it catches, giving your vehicle\u00a0the grip needed to free itself. You may need a lot of sticks and brush, and this certainly isn\u2019t the fastest means to extraction. (Never mind that all the sticks and brush in the world wouldn\u2019t have saved me from that mud hole.) But it\u2019s a good first option before resorting to more drastic means. Ultimately, though, if you plan to get off-road regularly, you\u2019ll want to invest in a more sophisticated method.", "(Photo:  Courtesy Smittybilt)", "At under $50, a good recovery strap is a cheap yet reliable piece of insurance against getting stuck. Immediately after getting my Land Cruiser freed from the mud pit, with help from some good ol\u2019 boys in a lifted,\u00a0seventies-era, flatbed diesel Dodge Ram, I went home and bought this CC330 strap ($40) from Smittybilt. I opted for one with nylon loops at the end instead of metal hooks, not wanting to deal with the potentially catastrophic whiplash of a hook that fails during use. A good-size strap for pulling one passenger vehicle with another is 20 to 40 feet long and between two to three inches wide (anything bigger is likely meant for heavier equipment).\u00a0Your owner\u2019s manual should outline appropriate recovery points on your specific car or truck. Make sure that you\u2019re attaching the strap to one of these spots\u00a0rather than a tie-down point (used only for shipping the car on a carrier), the axles, suspension, or\u2014God forbid\u2014the bodywork (bumper, fender, etc). That would almost certainly result in something expensive being torn off. On my Land Cruiser, I\u2019ve used the rear tow hitch, attaching\u00a0the strap with a simple girth hitch, feeding the loop on one end through the loop on the other, and pulling it tight. That said, if you\u2019re doing a lot of recovering, it\u2019s worth investing in a more durable D-ring shackle for your receiver hitch, like this one ($67) from Warn.", "Recovery straps work like big elastic bands and are designed to stretch. You\u2019ll want to start with some slack, enough that the strap lays on the ground and you have ten to twenty feet to drive before it becomes taut. This allows the vehicle doing the pulling some room to get a little momentum before the strap becomes tight enough to yank\u00a0on the stuck car. Essentially, this momentum loads the band with energy, which, once it reaches the limits of its stretch, should jerk the stuck vehicle forward. Don\u2019t go too fast. Five miles per hour is plenty to start, just enough to give things a little jolt. Finally, it may go without saying, but make sure to have the stuck car turned on,\u00a0in drive (or reverse if you\u2019re pulling the back end), and someone in the driver\u2019s seat ready to control it once it\u2019s free.", "One more thing: any time ropes, straps, or pulling is involved, a safe practice is to drape a heavy towel, blanket, or special damper over the middle of the strap before you start pulling. This way, if the strap tears, the blanket will weigh down the flying ends and keep them from whipping into your truck or a bystander. And speaking of other people, get everyone out of the cars and well away from the recovery.", "While a recovery strap won\u2019t do you much good if you\u2019re adventuring solo, it\u2019ll usually get the job done as long as you\u2019ve got someone else with you to do the pulling.", "(Photo:  Courtesy Maxtrax)", "Traction boards are typically made of orange plastic, covered in pegs, and measure about one foot by four feet. (You\u2019ve probably seen them on more than one occasion mounted to the side of a lifted Toyota Tacoma.) To use a traction board, you simply wedge it, peg\u00a0side up, under the wheel with the least traction, and gently step on the gas to avoid spinning the wheels. Similar to the sticks-and-brush method in the example above, this gives the spinning wheel something to bite on. Once they\u2019re properly in place, traction boards will almost certainly help any stuck vehicle get going again. Boards are also great for keeping your vehicle from getting stuck in the first place, as they can be used as ramps to climb up and over downed tree trunks or to make a bridge for traversing ruts or gullies in your path.", "The industry leader in traction boards is Maxtrax, and the MKII model sells for $300. This is certainly steep for what amounts to two semiflexible pieces of plastic, but you get what you pay for, and Maxtrax products are engineered to withstand serious punishment. Be wary of cheap knock-off traction boards. While you my find yourself drawn in by their low price, these will almost certainly be less durable and carry a lower weight rating than those from a reputable manufacturer.", "(Photo:  sergeyryzhov/iStock)", "If you need a winch, you probably already know it. These are essential for anyone planning on spending a lot of time solo off-roading on challenging terrain. A good rule of thumb is to opt for a winch with a weight rating of 1.5 to 2\u00a0times your truck\u2019s gross vehicle weight rating. So if your truck maxes out at 6,000 pounds when fully loaded up with gear, get a winch that can pull 9,000 to 12,000 pounds. Another important thing to decide is whether you want a nylon or steel cable. Nylon is lighter, cheaper, and safer, since it doesn\u2019t hold as much energy and thus won\u2019t become quite as lethal a whip if it breaks. Steel, on the other hand, is stronger and more durable. But when a steel cable fails, it does so spectacularly, with the risk for serious injury. Steel cables are also more expensive to replace.", "A winch mounted to the front of a vehicle can look a little complicated, but they\u2019re actually pretty easy to use. Typically, you\u2019ll be winching off a tree, so you want to make sure you get a tree-trunk protector, as wrapping a bare cable around a tree will shred the bark and potentially kill the tree. Also make sure that the tree is alive, as a dead one will likely rip right out of the ground once you start pulling. Much of the same logic used with a recovery strap applies to winching as well: it\u2019s a good idea to throw a blanket over the line once you start pulling to hold the flying ends down in case of a break. Winches are controlled by a remote that either plugs into the winch itself when needed\u00a0or is completely wireless. Wireless remotes are nice, because they allow you to easily control the winch from the driver\u2019s seat during solo extractions. You can also winch off\u00a0another vehicle\u00a0or use the winch on your vehicle to pull another vehicle free. Here, too, make sure to only hook onto the specified recovery points, and it\u2019s a good idea to have one of those trailer-hitch D-ring shackles mentioned above.", "Warn, the industry leader when it comes to winches, offers a few different categories. Its Zeon line ($1,116 and up) is a great place to start your search as it offers 8,000-, 10,000-, and 12,000-pound pulling capacities and features like an IP68 waterproof and dustproof\u00a0rating. And be warned:\u00a0winches are pricey. But if you know you\u2019ll need one, it\u2019s worth the investment.", "Which method makes sense for you will depend primarily on what kind of off-roading you do and how often you do it. Drive down a forest road once or twice a year? You\u2019re probably safe relying on sticks and brush as your contingency plan. Spend a lot of time off-roading in a group? A tow strap could come in handy\u00a0and could score you points with the rest of the crew when someone inevitably gets stuck. Do a lot of solo adventuring? Maxtrax and a winch are worthwhile.", "Our mission to inspire readers to get outside has never been more critical.

Furthermore, these enable slower, more controlled movement from your winch.", "If you connect your winch to another vehicle, attach a tow strap to the end of your winch line and always hook to the frame or a recovery point that is directly bolted to the frame. It doesn't take much for bumpers to break off and become lethal flying objects.", "Regardless of what you attach to, always make sure it\u2019s solid enough to handle the weight of your vehicle. Don\u2019t turn your tree saver strap into a tree removal device.", "Today's snow chains can be installed by just about anyone, and many are more like wrap-around cables than actual chains. To put these on, park your vehicle and wrap the snow chains around the wheel. A central bungee cord tightens everything up.

Unless you are on solid ground (concrete or asphalt), stomping the pedal and spinning the wheels is just going to make it worse.", "Use your throttle sparingly and in the right way. If too much power is overpowering the tires and snow, use part throttle. You would be surprised how less power might just get you out.", "Make sure your automatic transmission is shifted into the lowest gear. For manual transmissions, you actually want to shift into a higher gear, such as 3rd or 4th, and use the clutch to control the spin. There will be less shock on the tires and you will have more control to keep the tires from spinning.", "This one might seem counter-intuitive, but when you are stuck and need power to the wheels, any slipping will cut the power right when you need it.

Watch out for using too much power though (see #2)", "The classic \u201cunstuck\u201d move is called rocking. This is a maneuver where use the engine to roll the vehicle forward, put it in reverse, roll it backward, and then shift to drive and roll forward.

It is a good idea to carry a bucket or bag of sand, pebbles, kitty litter, etc when you live in snow-prone areas.", "Make sure your tires are pointed straight. There is considerably more stress on the tires when they are turned. This means means it is harder for the vehicle to move, and therefore easier for the tire to spin rather than get traction and push or pull the vehicle out of the mess.", "When you just can\u2019t get the grip, try letting some air out of the tires.

Hi-Lift (yes, the fantastic jack company) just released possibly one of the best renditions of this standby: the Handle-All. Essentially, the Handle-All combines the breakdown storage functionality of a trenching shovel with either a short or full-sized handle and removable full-sized shovel head, axe head, pick head, and sledgehammer head, and the best part is that it all goes into a tiny bag the size of a bag of potato chips. This is a must-keep tool in the vehicle at all times!", "Power Tools", "Occasionally, we have found the need for a chainsaw in our truck's arsenal for light cutting work. This work ranges from cutting limbs to use for material wedged under the tires to cutting up full-sized trees blown down across an old road.
