Here are some tips to help you get started.", "Pampered pets are all the rage these days, as evidenced by the growing popularity of doggie day spas and pet groomer salons that offer services ranging from high-fashion haircuts to \"peticures,\"\u00a0massage and aromatherapy treatments, even facials\u2014and pet tattoos!", "On the more practical side, many pets merely require simple bathing, hair trimming, nail clipping, and other old-fashioned pet groomer services. Either way, Americans spent $4.16 billion on pet services in 2012 alone, and that number is expected only to increase. For those who wish to get on the pet groomer bandwagon by offering in-store pet grooming services, here are some basics.", "First, a prospective pet groomer must really love animals, have a lot of patience, and have a good rapport with pets, as well as people, for this endeavor. So start by doing some research on pet groomer careers and the market in your area. Consider how much you will need to make and what you will need to charge for your services. At first, it can be a little tricky to determine a proper pricing strategy. You can start by checking out the competition and evaluating your potential client base.", "It's also important to evaluate the area market in terms of potential competition, your location, and if you have enough funds for start-up expenses because, initially at least, this is an expensive undertaking.", "As this is a very physical endeavor, demanding that you lift pets and engage in other tasks that require strength and stamina, you should determine if you are capable of this. Remember to take your other health factors into consideration. If you have asthma, arthritis, or pet allergies, for example, this may not be the right undertaking for you.", "Does your establishment have the right amount of space to accommodate pet groomer services? You must also have the right kind of space, preferably tiled or another water-resistant flooring, proper plumbing, convenient access to bathing facilities, and safely placed electrical outlets, among other features. Cleanliness and safety are vitally important as well.", "Licensing and formal schooling are not required in order to become a pet groomer. In fact, many groomers rely on on-the-job training or apprenticeships to learn their skills. However, it's highly advisable to seek professional schooling and certification for greater knowledge and confidence, so that you can safely and effectively service your four-legged customers.", "There are a number of online and correspondence courses, plus continuing education programs and vocational schools that offer comprehensive pet groomer training, which can lead to certification.", "Some states require that groomers obtain licenses to administer flea and tick treatments. A school or program administrator can tell you if you need this, and how to go about becoming licensed.", "You'll also need to stock up on some supplies and equipment before you get started. Look into sourcing the following materials and their associated costs:", "While vocational licensing is not required at this time, your city or municipality may demand that you acquire certain business licenses and permits, even if a pet groomer is doing this out of their home. Check with the city, town, or county government offices to learn what is required. Another good resource is the local chamber of commerce.", "Insurance is a must, as even the most competent, cautious, responsible pet groomer is not immune from accidentally injuring animals due to grooming mishaps, pets' possible allergic reactions to products, and other potentially hazardous scenarios. General business and homeowners' insurance does not cover these. So do your homework in regard to what type of small business insurance that's required.", "The most common form is liability insurance tailored to this particular business. You may also want to consider adding commercial or general liability insurance. As this is a very specialized business, which presents the potential for accidents and injuries, it's important to obtain the right kind of insurance coverage.", "Another popular trend is mobile pet grooming, totally self-contained vans that travel to pets' homes enabling a pet groomer to perform services right outside a pet's door. Self-service dog\u00a0washes, which provide facilities for people to bathe their pets themselves, also are gaining popularity.", "Some car washes are even adding these, to expand their businesses. The latter may have a part-time groomer on staff, to provide services the owners can't perform themselves. So this may be a good option for those just starting out.", "While pooches comprise the majority of patrons who seek pet grooming services, be prepared to cater to cats, as well.

Nails are trimmed whenever pets are groomed, however this service can also be performed between regular grooming appointments.", "Cleaning ears helps to remove dirt and debris, and allows for groomers to monitor ear health.

In 1983, Dr. Robert Loeb created a prototype that used a vigorous spray of water that incorporated medicated shampoo solution to penetrate the thick coat of his dog, Keesha, to reach her affected skin. This became the original prototype of Hydrosurge. He pursued its development by consulting veterinarians and other pet professionals. The machine was so successful with treating skin conditions that he began his work modifying the appliance to also be compatible in the professional pet bathing industry.", "In 1986, Dr. Norman Costello (the creator and founder of The Animal Keeper and Pet Suites) bought one of Dr. Loeb\u2019s prototypes. Dr. Costello became extremely interested in the product, not only for its therapeutic value, but also for the product\u2019s potential to save water, labor, and product. He saw a future for Hydrosurge in his boarding kennels, and in 1991, Dr. Loeb and Dr. Norm Costello came together to form Hydrosurge, Inc.

The infection is often due to an organism, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that is associated with water environments. Because of this association, most affected dogs have a history of grooming, scrubbing, or toweling two days prior to symptoms (range 1-7 days). In humans, a similar type of infection has been noted after use of hot tubs. The precise source of the bacteria is not always clear as cultures from shampoo bottles are infrequently positive.", "Large-breed dogs with thick wiry or short coats may be more commonly affected. The skin lesions on the neck, back, and tail are often painful. In thick-furred dogs (ex. German shepherds, Labrador retrievers, Golden retrievers, Welsh Corgis), the red, crusted, oozing lesions may be hidden by the fur, so shaving is sometimes needed to better visualize. The majority of patients feel systemically unwell with lethargy, fever, and sometimes, gastrointestinal signs. These systemic signs develop because of toxins released by the bacteria in the skin.", "The diagnosis can be tricky if a patient presents only with a fever of unknown origin. Labwork may be performed given the systemic signs. The history of recent bathing and location of painful lesions can be helpful.", "Definitive diagnosis usually requires a combination of biopsy for histopathology and culture. Histopathology involves lab processing and interpretation by a pathologist under the microscope. If Pseudomonas or a similar bacteria is grown on culture, then there will be information as to which antibiotic may be appropriate; it is important to have this information as Pseudomonas can often be resistant to many types of antibiotics. These results can often take several days.", "Since diagnostics can take several days for confirmation, and the patient is usually acutely ill, antibiotics are typically started pending results, based on clinical suspicion. The antibiotic typically chosen, a fluoroquinolone, is not one of the first-line treatments used for other types of skin infections, but it can be very effective for Pseudomonas. Many patients can improve within 24-48 hours of the first few doses of the antibiotic, but it is important to continue treatment until otherwise directed (usually 4-6 weeks given the deep infection). This class of antibiotic can be relatively expensive.", "Other supportive measures may be started depending on symptoms, such as intravenous fluids, pain medications, and gastrointestinal medication may be considered.", "Because the precise source of the bacteria has not yet been discerned, not all cases can be prevented.

Especially if the canine, or feline, has long hair. This requires professional grooming to be done every few months.", "First, if an individual owns a short haired dog or cat, it\u2019s important for them to get bathed every few months. They don\u2019t necessarily need a hair cut. During this process, it\u2019s good to gently brush the animals hair coat to remove any loose hair and to help keep the hair coat healthy. It will also take care of their under coat, which is a thick layer of fur that protects them against the water and cold weather.", "Not all breeds have an undercoat though. A groomer would be able to tell the client what type of brush to use on\u00a0a given hair coat. Furthermore, if the animal has dry skin,\u00a0 the groomer\u00a0can use oatmeal shampoo and conditioner to relieve the skin, moisturize it, and help avoid any temporary irritation such as itching.", "Dry skin can be caused from poor grooming.\u00a0Especially for a dog or cat that is overweight because its hard for them to groom themselves. Many older animals have this problem since many of them develop arthritis as they get older.

The skin can also get irritated from any flea infestations. In this case, the groomer will be able to give the animal a flea bath and possibly an oatmeal bath as well to relieve the skin from itching.", "When it comes to an animal with a longer hair coat, professional grooming is a must. Dogs and cats that have long hair tend to get matted (have knots). Brushing needs to be done on a daily basis in the household.

By the time they finally come in for grooming, at the beginning of spring, they are matted to the skin,\u201d\u00a0said Roda.", "If the animal is severely matted, sometimes the animal will need to be sedated for grooming since it can be very painful. A lot of times, the groomer will have to shave all of the hair off in situations like this. Sedation can be done at an animal hospital\u00a0and it\u2019s a plus if an individual can find a groomer that works in an animal hospital so that if any issues arise, then the veterinarian can be there to help. Many times, matting of the hair coat can cause some major skin irritations.", "\u201cDue to the heavy matting, irritations and sores can develop on the skin which cant be seen through the mats,\u201d explained Roda.", "Another important part of grooming is nail trimming. This can be done in the house hold, at the groomers, or even at a veterinary hospital. Many people don\u2019t feel comfortable trimming their dogs nails. In that case, a veterinarian would be more then happy to help. Usually it will cost a small fee for a professional to trim the nails. When a dog, or cat, is brought in for grooming, the nail trimming is usually included in with the price of the grooming. When the nails get too long, it makes it very uncomfortable for the animal.", "According to Roda, \u201cIt should be done often so that dogs and cats don\u2019t have trouble walking.\u201d", "With Halloween\u00a0coming up some pet owners like to to dress up their furry friends.\u00a0 There are groomers that\u00a0offer dying hair for dogs using all sorts of colors.", "The hair dye that these groomers use is non toxic for animals.", "Grooming the animal often will save the client money in the long run.

From proper animal socialization to coat and skin health, regular grooming has a number of benefits that may be reaped.", "", "So without delay, here are 5 reasons to regularly groom your pet.", "Socialize\nWhen it comes to dogs and cats, the most common pets, performing some grooming rituals daily helps the animal become accustomed to being touched. Brushing your pet\u2019s hair each evening can help relax you, as well as the animal. Your pet will get acquainted with you more \u00a0as you teach it to lie down calmly while you lavish it with attention, de-tangle its hair and remove any debris from its coat. This is especially true for clipping the nails of your dog or cat. Performing the chore weekly, or at least every other week, will make it easier, in the long run, to care for your animal\u2019s feet.", "Control Shedding\nShedding is also a major issue that can be remedied with regular grooming. While all shedding cannot be completely avoided, daily brushing and weekly baths with a conditioning shampoo will help cut back on the need to vacuum the carpet. A drop in shedding will be noticed when you regularly use a pet brush, since the brush stimulates oil producing glands in the animal\u2019s skin that help keep it healthy and hanging onto hair. Sometimes it is easier and even better to have your pet groomed by a professional. A trained professional will know the proper way to groom your pet, specific to each breed and will be able to trim your pet\u2019s hair, which is especially helpful for pets with thick coats.", "Avoid Medical Problems\nSome actions, such as checking an animal\u2019s eyes, teeth, and ears regularly, can help you avoid major medical bills. Many cat and dog breeds are susceptible to illnesses that can be caught early, simply by paying attention to your pet and thoroughly checking the animal\u2019s entire body during daily grooming sessions.", "Dental Health\nBrushing a pet\u2019s teeth is another ritual to perform regularly. A pet\u2019s dental health can have tremendous effects on its overall physical well-being. By keeping your animal\u2019s teeth clean, you will also help keep the animal well between vet check-ups, and can also avoid expenses related to professional cleanings.", "Appearance\nA final benefit is all about looks. Animals feel better when they are groomed, and also tend to look better. Keep your dog or cat in top condition by tending to its needs regularly. Avoid matted hair that is difficult to untangle, nails that are too long and curled and other issues by paying attention to your pet each day. If you don\u2019t have time to groom your pet yourself, schedule an appointment with us\u00a0at Pet Palace,\u00a0where we have the knowledge and care to take care of your beloved pet.

Routine: Develop a routine that works for both you and your dog. Same shampoo, same bathing spot, same steps every time. This makes it easier on you and they\u2019ll know what to expect and be less anxious. Make sure to clean every part of their body, including the belly and face, and make sure that you rinse thoroughly. You don\u2019t want any shampoo residue left on the skin or in the coat.", "2. Choose the Shampoo: Just like for humans, there are a variety of canine shampoos. What you choose will be based on your needs:", "In general, oatmeal-based shampoos are usually the best basic option. Additionally, conditioners can be used if your dog has dry or sensitive skin, and dry or brittle hair. It also can help reduce matting.", "3. Deshedding/Dematting: Take a comb or brush and work through the coat as you\u2019re rinsing to rid your dog of excess loose hair and to detangle any mats that they\u2019ve developed. You\u2019ll find it easier you do this during the bathing routine, rather than when you\u2019re trying to dry them.", "4. Grooming Equipment: If you plan on doing all the grooming yourself, one highly recommended professional dog grooming tip is not to skimp on the tools you\u2019ll need (brushes, scissors, trimmers). Not only will they last longer, but they will work better than their cheaper cousins. Make sure that you clean your equipment after every use and lubricate and sharpen as necessary to prolong the life of the tool.", "5. Organize Your Equipment: Having everything in one place \u2014 shampoo, combs, brushes, scissors, trimmers, etc. \u2014 will keep the process moving along. There\u2019s nothing like an anxious dog making its escape while you search for the right pair of scissors.", "6. Get a Helping Hand: Many dogs will not sit still for drying and trimming, so you might need a little help. One dog-grooming trick is to use a Groomers Helper device to stabilize your dog and keep him from struggling, biting or spinning. It will actually make your job go by all that much faster, a relief for the dog as well. If equipment isn\u2019t in your budget, ask a family member or friend your pet is comfortable with to lend a helping hand.", "7. Dry Before Grooming: Make sure that you thoroughly dry your dog before grooming. Partially dried coats will tend to curl more, making it difficult to get an even trim. This way you can do one pass with the clippers, rather than two.", "8. Clippers 101: If you\u2019ll be trimming your dog\u2019s coat, you will need a pair of clippers and one or more blades. Blades are numbered differently than human clipper blades, where 1 is the shortest. To keep your dog\u2019s coat longer, use a #5/8, #3, or #4. For a shorter cut, go with #5, #7, #9, or #10. Make sure that your blade is a finish-cut or FC version. The teeth are spaced a bit farther apart and the blades aren\u2019t as sharp as a skip-tooth blade, which should be reserved for pro groomers. Also, for armpits, around eyes and in the sanitary area, use only a #10 blade.", "9. Grooming Made Easy: Always go with the lay of the hair when trimming. Keep the tip of your blade down against the skin, holding the back at an angle. Then pull the skin taut as you move your trimmer along the coat (to avoid cutting the skin).", "10. Trimming Paws: If you need to trim between the pads or around the edge of the paws, one of the simplest dog grooming tips is to move your dog to the edge of the work surface, so it makes it easier for you to get to.", "11. Right Tool for Trimming Nails: There are a variety of clippers available, from electric dremel-style tools to scissor and guillotine styles. There is no need to invest in an electric dremel nail grinder. It is more expensive than the other styles and the noise can be off-putting to your dog, who probably isn\u2019t fond of the procedure to begin with.", "12. How to Trim the Nails: Start with the back paws, as they tend to be less sensitive. Hold the paw firmly in your hand. Cut the end off the nail, below the quick, at a 45-degree angle. You can choose to take several small cuts or one larger cut, but be very careful not to cut too deep. (Some clippers come with a guide that only allows you to cut a small amount at a time.) You can trim the nail up until you see a small black dot in the center, surrounded by white.", "Note: Keep styptic powder, which comes in a special holder, nearby in case you cut the nail too short. The holder makes it easy to grab and dip the nail into for stem any bleeding.", "If you want to get real fancy and paint the toenails on your dog, slip the end of a leg of pantyhose over the dog\u2019s paw, poking the nails through the nylon.

When checking their nails, particular attention should be placed on the dew claws (these are the nails located higher up on your dog\u2019s forelimb paw and don\u2019t touch the ground).

Its stylists complete more than 800 hours of hands-on instruction and safety certification while working with 200 dogs of different breeds and sizes, and each salon associate must be safety certified annually, according to the company's website.", "In dealing with such an unregulated industry, Nash outlined steps that pet owners can take to help ensure the safety of their animal when taking it to the groomer.", "You should look for a certificate, find out the type of training groomers have had and see how long they have been in the profession, Nash advised.", "\"What's true of a lot of salons is that they have a huge turnover rate,'' she said. \"It's very hard to find good groomers.\"", "Nash also notes to ask if your groomer stays up with the latest information and methods by going to industry shows and other professional development events.", "Owners should also make sure the facility looks and smells clean, and check that groomers know CPR for cats and dogs in case they have to resuscitate an animal.", "Most facilities have an observation window or area where owners can watch the groomer at work \u2014 which Nash encourages pet owners to do if they don't have to rush out after dropping off their pet.", "\"You should always be able to see your pet because you can watch the handling,'' Nash said. \"I teach my staff and the students, you should never have to prepare for a visit (by a pet owner). If you keep a window, it creates a much safer environment for the pet and professional groomer.\"", "Owners should also check to make sure the groomer is always close to the dog. Since the animals are usually attached to grooming tables by leashes or nooses, if a groomer steps away and isn't paying attention, the animal could potentially break its neck or hang itself by the noose by jumping off the grooming area.", "It's also recommended that owners bring their dogs to the facility before they make an appointment so they can acclimate the animal to the environment.", "Most dogs enjoy being bathed, so it's the drying part that usually causes the most issues.", "The horror stories Nash has heard over the years often involve either faulty equipment or groomers who aren't properly educated in using it.

Another option is just putting the dog on a grooming table and using a small hand dryer.", "Some dogs with pushed-in faces, like boxers and pugs, might never acclimate to the force dryers because of natural breathing issues, which need to be clearly discussed with the groomer.", "\"That force of air can take their breath away, and when they experience it, they never forget it,'' Nash said.", "Owners also need to inform groomers of any medical issues the animal may have.", "Danielle DiNapoli, an owner of an English bulldog named Scruffles, told TODAY's Kristen Dahlgren that she warned the groomers at a PetSmart in Flemington, New Jersey, not to dry the bulldog because she gets anxious.

Dirty skin can lead to skin infections, ear infections, and foul odors. In the south, as in Homewood, pet grooming during our hot and humid summers is very important.Skin and ear infections are caused by an overgrowth of bacteria or yeast, commonly on the abdomen, between the toes, between any skin folds your pet may have (such as facial folds or around his or her neck or throat), or on the ear flap. These over-growths lead to inflamed skin, hair loss, weeping or oozing sores, and crusty lesions. If left untreated, skin infections can spread, causing diffuse problems which need to be treated with systemic drugs.Similarly, haircuts can help avoid skin issues as well. Hot spots and other lesions, severe matting, and not to mention shedding can all be avoided with a regular trip to the pet groomer.Pets need to have their nails trimmed regularly as well. Overgrown nails can curl under and dig into your pet\u2019s pad, causing pain and lameness.

Most animals can be taught to enjoy grooming at any age. Regular pet grooming will help you build and maintain healthy relationships with your pets, and practice gentle leadership skills.

If any parts seem sore, stop and schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for a checkup. If your pet seems uncomfortable with your touch, remember that animals learn positive associations with repetition and praise. You will need to be a kind, gentle leader but remain firm in your intentions. The plan is to teach your pet to enjoy being groomed and to groom your pet on a regular basis, not just when the animal is matted or really dirty.", "If you need help, you can start by accompanying your pet to a professional groomer for a lesson. Choose a groomer who is patient, gentle and kind. Most groomers are thrilled to meet people who want to work with their animals in between professional grooming visits.", "Here are some specifics about various aspects of grooming:", "Brushing. Brushing and combing should happen daily or at least several times each week, no matter what kind of coat your animal has. If you plan to give your pet a bath, do the brushing part first. Brushing and combing will feel good to your pet; it removes dead hair and tangles, and distributes natural skin oils. If the coat is thick, make sure you are combing all the way to the skin. Be gentle and patient, though; too much pressure on the skin can cause irritation called brush burn, and pulling the tangles will hurt if you try to hurry. A detangler can be used on dry hair to loosen any knots.", "Different types of brushes are used for different coats. A curved wire slicker or pin brush works well for long, straight coats. Use a regular wire slicker for medium-length hair and coats with a dense undercoat. I like rakes for brushing undercoats during the shedding season. Short, smooth coats can be brushed with a grooming mitt or rubber curry. After brushing, you can use an all-purpose comb to work out small knots the brush missed.", "Baths. The water should be warm, even in summer, because very cold water can chill animals and leave your pet with a bad association to bathing in general. If you are bathing small animals, support them in the tub so they don\u2019t panic. Give your pet a full body massage while lathering up the shampoo, then rinse. If you wish, add conditioner and comb through the coat before a final rinse. I comb through long-haired dogs and horses\u2019 tails with conditioner before doing the final rinse. On cold days, all animals should be dried, and very young, old or sick animals should always be dried to prevent chilling.", "Nails. Begin by picking up each foot and handling the nails. Then, without clipping, hold the clippers near a nail and squeeze the nail as though you are clipping. Look carefully for the quick \u2013 where the blood supply ends. You\u2019ll want to avoid cutting into the quick, since it is painful and will bleed. If you ever accidentally cut the quick, don\u2019t panic. Cover the nail end with your styptic powder and put pressure on the nail for 30 seconds, until it stops bleeding. Be gentle and patient with your pet. If you start by trimming one nail on each foot daily and rewarding with praise, you will soon have a relaxed, willing animal. Remember to also trim the dewclaws.", "If you keep your pets\u2019 nails trimmed, you will protect their feet from long nails that can become caught and break off, causing pain. Long nails can also cause permanent damage to toes by bending them into unnatural positions. Animals with hooves need routine foot care by professionals, so make sure they are getting the care they need.", "Teeth. You can gently massage the gums and brush the teeth on any pet \u2013 from the smallest rodents to the largest horses. If taught with patience and kindness, most animals enjoy a mouth massage. The benefits are healthy mouths and fresh breath. Plus, you\u2019ll be more aware of when your pet needs dental work by a professional, before your pet is in pain. Remember to use animal toothpaste appropriate for each type of pet.", "Ears. You should periodically check your animal\u2019s ears. If they are clean and free of debris, then give your pet a nice ear rub. Again, a gentle massage is going to give your pet a good association to your touch. If the ears are dirty, smell bad or look sore, make an appointment with your veterinarian. The doctor can check for infection or parasites, and can get you started with a cleaning lesson.", "If you are doing a quick cleaning to healthy ears, start by dampening a cotton ball with appropriate ear cleaner and wipe the folds of skin, starting near the head and cleaning out to the ends of the ear flaps. Do not use cotton swabs because they can reach too deeply inside the ear and cause damage. Some animals are sensitive to the feeling of the cleaner going in, so you might want to start with just a small amount. Be prepared to \u201cwear\u201d some ear cleaner, though, as most animals shake their heads and send it flying.", "Grooming can be a pleasurable activity for both you and your pets.
