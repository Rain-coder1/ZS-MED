Beyer speed figures\nBeyer numbers are one of the considerations to check the speed of your horse in the tournament. You will find it in the middle of DRF. You can use this to measure the past performance of the horse. The pace projection will help you find the horse that will benefit you in the tournament.\n2. Handicapping skills\nThis is one of the effective processes to find out the specific horse or horses that are likely to win the tournament. This is where your creative intelligence works. Here, the calculation is not involved. For this practice, the daily racing form is mandatory. You can buy it and enter the track.\n3. Have a look at the distance of racing\nIf you are going to bet for a horse in a tournament, you need to do some homework. One of the important factors to consider here is the distance. It is important to consider the pace, speed and distance of the horse that is involved in the process of running. This will indicate on how the horse will perform within the tournament were the races have different length.\n4. Form cycles consideration\nThere are certain questions that need to be asked in a horse racing tournament. One of it is \u2018what is the presentation of the horse in the last tournament of her?\u2019 Is there a chance that she will improve in this game? Which are the horses that raced with her in the same pace? What is the performance level of those horses?\n5. Individual character of each horse\nWhether you wish a horse to win or bet on specific horse, it is very important to have a note on each horse\u2019s character. The information on the DRF as well as other tidbits is important to consider here. Some horses may not behave in a similar way if the equipment of operation in racing changes. Thus, the owner must keep this in note.\n6. Two pocket workouts\nIt is always preferable to keep two options in hand. A strategic bettor would bet big sometimes. Again, he has the mental strength of betting small.

For those of you who have never heard of a horse jumping competition, it is very similar to a dog competition, where they jump over different obstacles in a certain order around the field, earningOne half of the field  and losing points for certain things. Each horse/rider team was different and I learned (some) how to keep track of the points. The whole competition was so pristine; brilliant white pants tucked into shiny knee-high boots, and perfectly fixed jackets or polos. Even the horses\u2019 hair was better braided or shinier than any girl\u2019s I have ever seen.   The competition was fun to watch and I even caught myself with a few gasps here and there as a horse refused a jump or a rider fell off, which happened a few times.

Or it could be playing a piece of music in your head that really pumps you up. Even humour can act as an effective cue for some riders.

Some popular forms of competition are grouped together at horse shows where horses perform in a wide variety of disciplines. Horses (and other equids such as mules) are used for non-competitive recreational riding such as fox hunting, trail riding, or hacking.

Indirect evidence suggests that horses were ridden long before they were driven. There is some evidence that about 3,000 BC, near the Dnieper River and the Don River, people were using bits on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit.[5] However, the most unequivocal early archaeological evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. Chariot burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as working animals. In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of war horses as light and heavy cavalry. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as transportation, trade and agriculture. Horses lived in North America, but died out at the end of the Ice Age. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of Columbus in 1493.[6] Equestrianism was introduced in the 1900 Summer Olympics as an Olympic sport with jumping events.", "Humans appear to have long expressed a desire to know which horse or horses were the fastest, and horse racing has ancient roots.

Both styles require riders to have a solid seat, with the hips and shoulders balanced over the feet, with hands independent of the seat so as to avoid disturbing the balance of the horse and interfering with its performance.", "The most noticeable feature of western style riding is in the saddle, which has a substantial saddle tree that provides support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to be attached to the saddle.", "Western horses are asked to perform with a loose rein, controlled by one hand. The standard western bridle lacks a noseband and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a curb bit that has somewhat longer and looser shanks than the curb of an English Weymouth bridle or a pelham bit. Two styles of Western reins developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the closed-end \"Romal\" reins of the California tradition, which have a long single attachment on the ends that can be used as a quirt. Modern rodeo competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a romal.", "Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. Cowboy boots, which have pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional riding boot, are designed to prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged\u2014most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes both men and women wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.", "Show events such as Western pleasure use much flashier equipment, unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and unobtrusive. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver. The rider may add a jacket or vest. Women's show clothing may feature vivid colors and even rhinestones or sequins.[11]", "Western horses are asked to have a brisk, ground-covering walk, but a slow, relaxed jog trot that allows the rider to sit the saddle and not post. The Western version of the canter is called a lope and while collected and balanced, is expected to be slow and relaxed. Working western horses seldom use a sustained hand gallop, but must be able to accelerate quickly to high speed when chasing cattle or competing in reining events, must be able to stop quickly from a dead run and \"turn on a dime.\"", "Horses, mules and donkeys are driven in harness in many different ways. For working purposes, they can pull a plow or other farm equipment designed to be pulled by animals. In many parts of the world they still pull wagons for basic hauling and transportation. They may draw carriages at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.", "As noted in \"horse racing\" above, horses can race in harness, pulling a very lightweight cart known as a sulky.

There are both competitive events and pleasure riding disciplines available.", "Handling, riding and driving horses have inherent risks. Horses are large prey animals with a well-developed flight or fight instinct able to move quickly and unexpectedly.

Other findings noted that helmets likely prevent traumatic brain injuries.[15]", "In the United States each year an estimated 30 million people ride horses, resulting in 50,000 emergency department visits (1 visit per 600 riders per year).[16] A survey of 679 equestrians in Oregon, Washington and Idaho estimated that at some time in their equestrian career one in five will be seriously injured, resulting in hospitalization, surgery or long-term disability.[17] Among survey respondents, novice equestrians had an incidence of any injury that was threefold over intermediates, fivefold over advanced equestrians, and nearly eightfold over professionals. Approximately 100 hours of experience are required to achieve a substantial decline in the risk of injury. The survey authors conclude that efforts to prevent equestrian injury should focus on novice equestrians.", "The most common injury is falling from the horse, followed by being kicked, trampled and bitten. About 3 out of 4 injuries are due to falling, broadly defined.[18][19] A broad definition of falling often includes being crushed and being thrown from the horse, but when reported separately each of these mechanisms may be more common than being kicked.[20][21]", "In Canada, a 10-year study of trauma center patients injured while riding reported that although 48% had suffered head injuries, only 9% of these riders had been wearing helmets at the time of their accident. Other injuries involved the chest (54%), abdomen (22%) and extremities (17%).[22] A German study reported that injuries in horse riding are rare compared to other sports, but when they occur they are severe. Specifically, they found that 40% of horse riding injuries were fractures, and only 15% were sprains. Furthermore, the study noted that in Germany, one quarter of all sport related fatalities are caused by horse riding.[23]\nMost horse related injuries are a result of falling from a horse, which is the cause of 60\u201380% of all such reported injuries.[18][24] Another common cause of injury is being kicked by a horse, which may cause skull fractures or severe trauma to the internal organs.  Some possible injuries resulting from horse riding, with the percent indicating the amounts in relation to all injuries as reported by a New Zealand study,[25] include:", "Among 36 members and employees of the Hong Kong Jockey Club who were seen in a trauma center during a period of 5 years, 24 fell from horses and 11 were kicked by the horse. Injuries comprised: 18 torso; 11 head, face or neck; and 11 limb.[26] The authors of this study recommend that helmets, face shields and body protectors be worn when riding or handling horses.", "In New South Wales, Australia, a study of equestrians seen at one hospital over a 6-year period found that 81% were wearing a helmet at the time of injury, and that helmet use both increased over time and was correlated with a lower rate of admission.[27] In the second half of the study period, of the equestrians seen at a hospital, only 14% were admitted. In contrast, a study of child equestrians seen at a hospital emergency department in Adelaide reported that 60% were admitted.[28]", "In the United States, an analysis of National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data performed by the Equestrian Medical Safety Association studied 78,279 horse-related injuries in 2007: \"The most common injuries included fractures (28.5%); contusions/abrasions (28.3%); strain/sprain (14.5%); internal injury (8.1%); lacerations (5.7%); concussions (4.6%); dislocations (1.9%); and hematomas (1.2%). Most frequent injury sites are the lower trunk (19.6%); head (15.0%); upper trunk (13.4%); shoulder (8.2%); and wrist (6.8%). Within this study patients were treated and released (86.2%), were hospitalized (8.7%), were transferred (3.6%), left without being treated (0.8%), remained for observation (0.6%) and arrived at the hospital deceased (0.1%).\"[29]", "Horseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports, especially in relation to head injury. Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually.[30] On average, about 67,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year from injuries sustained while working with horses.[31] 15,000 of those admittances are from traumatic brain injuries. Of those, about 60 die each year from their brain injuries.[32] Studies have found horseback riding to be more dangerous than several sports, including skiing, auto racing and football.[22] Horseback riding has a higher hospital admittance rate per hours of riding than motorcycle racing, at 0.49 per thousand hours of riding and 0.14 accidents per thousand hours, respectively.[22]", "Head injuries are especially traumatic in horseback riding. About two-thirds of all riders requiring hospitalization after a fall have sustained a traumatic brain injury.[33] Falling from a horse without wearing a helmet is comparable to being struck by a car.[34] Most falling deaths are caused by head injury.[34]", "The use of riding helmets substantially decreases the likelihood and severity of head injuries. When a rider falls with a helmet, he or she is five times less likely to experience a traumatic brain injury than a rider who falls without a helmet.[33] Helmets work by crushing on impact and extending the length of time it takes the head to stop moving.[35] Despite this, helmet usage rates in North America are estimated to be between eight and twenty percent.[36]", "Once a helmet has sustained an impact from falling, that part of the helmet is structurally weakened, even if no visible damage is present.[37] Helmet manufacturers recommend that a helmet that has undergone impact from a fall be replaced immediately. In addition, helmets should be replaced every three to five years; specific recommendations vary by manufacturer.[38]", "Many organizations mandate helmet use in competition or on show grounds, and rules have continually moved in the direction of requiring helmet use. In 2011, the United States Equestrian Federation passed a rule making helmet use mandatory while mounted on competition grounds at U.S. nationally rated eventing competitions.[39] Also in 2011, the United States Dressage Federation made helmet use in competition mandatory for all riders under 18 and all riders who are riding any test at Fourth Level and below.[40] If a rider competing at Prix St. Georges and above is also riding a test at Fourth Level or below, he or she must also wear a helmet at all times while mounted.", "The idea that riding a horse astride could injure a woman's sex organs is a historic, but sometimes popular even today, misunderstanding or misconception, particularly that riding astride can damage the hymen.[41] Evidence of injury to any female sex organs is scant. In female high-level athletes, trauma to the perineum is rare and is associated with certain sports (see Pelvic floor#Clinical significance). The type of trauma associated with equestrian sports has been termed \"horse riders' perineum\".[42] A case series of 4 female mountain bike riders and 2 female horse riders found both patient-reported perineal pain and evidence of sub-clinical changes in the clitoris;[43] the relevance of these findings to horse riding is unknown.", "In men, sports-related injuries are among the major causes of testicular trauma. In a small controlled but unblinded study of 52 men, varicocele was significantly more common in equestrians than in non-equestrians.[44] The difference between these two groups was small, however, compared to differences reported between extreme mountain bike riders and non-riders,[45] and also between mountain bike riders and on-road bicycle riders.[46] Horse-riding injuries to the scrotum (contusions) and testes (blunt trauma) were well known to surgeons in the 19th century and early 20th century.[47] Injuries from collision with the pommel of a saddle are mentioned specifically.[47]", "Organized welfare groups, such as the Humane Society of the United States, and animal rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, have been known to criticise some horse sports with claims of animal cruelty.", "Horse racing is a popular equestrian sport which is practiced in many nations around the world. It is inextricably associated with gambling, where in certain events, stakes can become very high. Despite its illegality in most competitions, these conditions of extreme competitiveness can lead to the use of performing-enhancing drugs and extreme training techniques, which can result in negative side effects for the horses' well-being.\nThe races themselves have also proved dangerous to the horses \u2013 especially steeplechasing, which requires the horse to jump hurdles whilst galloping at full speed. This can result in injury or death to the horse, as well as the jockey.[48] A study by animal welfare group Animal Aid revealed that approximately 375 racehorses die yearly, with 30% of these either during or as a result of injuries from a race.[49] The report also highlighted the increasing frequency of race-related illnesses, including bleeding lungs (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) and gastric ulcers.[49]", "Animal rights groups are also primarily concerned that certain sports or training exercises may cause unnecessary pain or injuries to horse athletes. Some specific training or showing practices are so widely condemned that they have been made illegal at the national level and violations can incur criminal penalties. The most well-known is soring, a practice of applying a caustic ointment just above the hooves of a Tennessee Walking Horse to make it pick up its feet higher. However, in spite of a federal law in the United States prohibiting this practice and routine inspections of horse shows by inspectors from the United States Department of Agriculture, soring is still widespread and difficult to eliminate.[50] Some events themselves are also considered so abusive that they are banned in many countries. Among these are horse-tripping, a sport where riders chase and rope a loose-running horse by its front legs, throwing it to the ground.[51]", "Secondary effects of racing have also recently been uncovered. A 2006 investigation by The Observer in the UK found that each year 6,000\u201310,000 horses are slaughtered for consumption abroad, a significant proportion of which are horses bred for racing.[52] A boom in the number of foals bred has meant that there is not adequate resources to care for unwanted horses. Demand has increased for this massive breeding programme to be scaled back.[52] Despite over 1000 foals being produced annually by the Thoroughbred horse industry, 66% of those bred for such a purpose were never entered into a race, and despite a life expectancy of 30 years, many are killed before their fifth birthday.[52]", "Horse riding events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the \u20ac10 Greek Horse Riding commemorative coin, minted in 2003 to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics. On the composition of the obverse of this coin, the modern horseman is pictured as he jumps over an obstacle, while in the background the ancient horseman is inspired by a representation on a black-figure vase of the 5th century BC.", "For the 2012 Olympics, the Royal Mint has produced a 50p coin showing a horse jumping a fence.[53]"]], "https://www.123rf.com/photo_148469605_uzbekistan-parkent-08-03-2019-ulak-kupkari-buzkashi-kok-boru-traditional-horse-riding-competition-in.html": [{"h1": ["Stock Photo - Uzbekistan, Parkent-08/03/2019: Ulak-Kupkari (Buzkashi, Kok-Boru) -traditional horse riding competition in Uzbekistan"], "h2": [], "h3": ["EDIT PHOTO WITH", "EDIT PHOTO WITH"], "h4": ["AI-POWERED PHOTO EDITING!"], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["Smarter editing with AI-powered editor", "Faster results!

English bridles also vary in style based on discipline, but most feature some type of cavesson noseband as well as closed reins, buckled together at the ends, that prevents them from dropping on the ground if a rider becomes unseated.

The \"posting trot\" is used most often in a working or extended trot, although there are also times when English riders may sit the trot; the \"sitting trot\" is most often used to ride collected forms of the trot seen in dressage, show hack and hunt seat equitation competition.

This could be because the only exposure most people have had to equestrianism is television, where horseback riding is done by professionals so skilled they make it look effortless, or dude-string type horses who are saintly enough to carry unbalanced, unskilled human cargo. What the average non-rider doesn't see are the hours of practice, the sore muscles, bruising, and chafing\u2014not to mention the mental challenge that riders undergo to make it all look easy.", "The Australian Sports Commission defines a sport as: \u201ca human activity capable of achieving a result requiring physical exertion and/or physical skill, which, by its nature and organization, is competitive and is generally accepted as being a sport.\u201d By that definition alone, there is no doubt that horseback riding is a sport. Let\u2019s look at how it fulfills that definition.", "Sport often means there is a competitive side to an activity, and horseback riding definitely provides the opportunity for that. Even if it appears that the horse is being judged, the horse is rarely better than the trainer or rider who prepared it. It still takes hours of human physical activity until a horse is competition ready. There is a huge list of competitive disciplines in the horse world, and success in one doesn't mean a rider will be good in another, any more than a downhill skier could automatically expect to be equally skilled in cross-country skiing. However, all require a level of fitness and skill.", "Sports require and build fitness: muscle strength, balance, flexibility, agility, and overall body awareness. Even after a short ride, non-riders will notice certain muscles will be quite sore. Riding requires a few muscles that aren't often used in other sports. The control it takes to use rein, leg and seat aids to influence a horse requires refined body awareness somewhat similar to a gymnast. While it's not necessary to be a bodybuilder to ride, dealing with an animal many times larger than yourself\u00a0does require some physical presence.", "Skill, strategy, reasoning, memory, and confidence are required in most sports, and it is no different for riding. Memorizing dressage tests and jump courses, following trail maps, choosing the safest route on a trail ride, deciding the most effective way to handle a horse that is acting up (that sometimes requires split-second timing) and always being aware of what your horse is thinking is a mental exercise. Football players may spend weeks memorizing a play. Riders also memorize how they will ride a particular course or cue a horse for a specific move, often within minutes of competing. However, they also need to be mentally flexible enough to change course instantaneously if the horse misbehaves, spooks or somehow the 'playing field' suddenly changes.", "Trot a few circles and you'll also find that horseback riding is an aerobic and calorie-burning activity as well. According to healthstatus.com, a 150 lb person riding a horse at a walk would burn 171 calories per hour, which is almost identical to walking on foot 2 miles per hour.\u00a0While trotting\u00a0441 calories are burned in an hour, and 549 calories are burned in an hour of galloping. Compare this to an hour of golf, carrying your clubs at 414 calories, or running at 7mph at 783 calories. Very few riders just ride and grooming, stall cleaning, carrying hay bales and feed bags means not only is the activity of riding aerobic, but the activities required to prepare to ride are also cardio building and fat burning.", "Sports are often governed by strict rules and may be played at an amateur or professional level. Open the rule book of any equestrian discipline and you'll likely find a very strict set of regulations that not only outline the \"rules of the game\" but may include rules about clothing, saddlery, bits, the size or type of horse and many other details.", "If you're still not convinced horseback riding is a sport, you should take a riding lesson with a coach who understands your opinion. After a very short time, you might agree that horseback riding does indeed fulfill the definition of a sport."]], "https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170805-249543/": [{"h1": ["Middle East Near You", "Palestinians take part in horse riding competition in Gaza Strip"], "h2": ["", "Creating New Perspectives"], "h3": ["Related", "Latest Updates", "Columnist", "Regular Contributors", "Reports & Resources", "Stay Informed", "Middle East Monitor"], "h4": ["Spotted an error on this page?

Given the few choices of colors for the jacket we have to focus on personalized\naccessories.\nFor example like the Cap, the saddle cover for our horse and the Tendon Boots, but let me examine an accessory at a time.\nFirst of all I wore this competition look to shoot a video, dedicated to my passion, but I will\n reveal all the details in November \u2026\nIf you want to take a look to the other equestrian looks  CLICK HERE.", "Horse Riding Competitions Outfit: Having little choice of colors for our outfits, as I said in the previous paragraph, we have to focus on customization in order to make the viewers remember us visually. This is why I\nchose to compose a garment that is intoned to my overall horse look. The Cap I bought it on the Kep Italia web site, which has a composer where each of us can play to create the\ncustom cap. We can choose everything from the visor to a front bezel with swarovski. In addition to the various shades we can choose different materials and different leathers.\nThe Cap I\u2019m wearing I personally composed it, and matches the orange Herm\u00e8s under saddle and the tendon boots always of the same color.", "", "As mentioned in the first paragraph the competition boots must be strictly black, but they\ndon\u2019t specify of which color the seams should be, and the details of the boot.\nIn collaboration with Secchiari we designed the boots you see me wearing in the photos:\nBlack with orange profiling and my initials. Because personalization is the key to creating any outfit, in any context from the equestrian discipline to the fashion world.\nAlways remember This!!\nHorse\u00a0Riding Competitions Outfit: Obviously pants from competition must be strictly white or cream, I have chosen those of Cavalleria Toscana that I paired with the shirt and jacket from the competition of the same brand.\nAre you ready to create your look for the competition?", "", "", "", "Your email address will not be published.

The Chesapeake native, who took her first horse riding lesson 18 months ago, represented the JMU Equestrian Club May 9-10 at the International Horse Show Association's national competition in Lexington, Ky.", "\"I have had to learn a lot very quickly because many of these girls have been riding since they were six or seven years old,\" said Jarzombek, who had ridden casually before coming to JMU but never had any formal training.", "Jarzombek competed in individual walk-trot equitation on the flat. The class features competitors who enter a ring at the same time, walk, trot, change direction and finish in the middle of the ring. Riders do not bring their own horses to IHSA shows, but ride horses provided by the host school. \"It is nerve-wracking because you don't know the horse you will ride until five seconds before you ride it,\" said Jarzombek.", "Coach Bobby Jones, owner and trainer of Seventh Heaven Farm in Mauzy, where the JMU Equestrian Club trains, advised Jarzombek \"to focus on the experience, not the pressure of being there.\" Since horses pick up on the nerves of the rider, Jones said, Jarzombek will have to stay focused and calm.", "JMU's Equestrian Club participates in riding styles that focus on a rider's body position on the horse. Points are given or taken away based on a rider's posture and ability to mesh with the horse.", "Throughout the IHSA show season, JMU riders compete against some schools that have school-funded varsity programs. Jarzombek thinks JMU's non-varsity status for the equestrian team accelerated her opportunity to compete. The IHSA requires teams to register riders at every level from beginner through open, or most advanced. Allison Smyrl, Equestrian Club president said, \"We are really lucky to have her, because it is often hard to fill that (beginner) position since the rider needs to have less than 24 weeks of instruction before they first compete in an IHSA show at that level. She definitely has a natural talent with riding and was able to pick up on it quickly.\"", "JMU participated in the regional show against 12 other schools. The top three riders in each level advanced to zones. The IHSA Zone 4 competition took place April 11 and consisted of 47 schools from three regions. The top two riders in each level at zones advanced to the IHSA Nationals. Jarzombek was the only JMU rider to make it to nationals.", "Jarzombek, who now rides two to three days a week, said she has learned a lot about horses and about herself in the short time she has been involved with the JMU club, which caught her attention at JMU's student organization night September of her freshman year. \"Riding challenges you physically, mentally and emotionally,\" she said. \"I have learned to overcome fear and apply that to other aspects of my life.\"", "Jarzombek remains excited about riding for JMU. She will move beyond the beginner class in competition next year and she will serve as equestrian club president for 2010-11.", "\"Bekah making it to (IHSA) nationals was a great accomplishment for her and our team. She has worked really hard at practices and put in a lot of effort to get to where she is now,\" said Smyrl.", "Back to Top", "Published: Friday, May 7, 2010", "Last Updated: Monday, June 8, 2020", "FOIA", "CARES Act", "Title IX Policies", "Clery Act and Campus Safety", "Student Consumer Information", "Annual Security and Fire Safety Report", "\u00a9 2020\u00a0JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY"]]}
