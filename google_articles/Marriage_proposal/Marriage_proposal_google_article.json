But as we're sure you already know, figuring out how to propose is a major undertaking (hello, ring shopping, and memorizing that speech).", "To make your long-awaited moment run as smoothly as possible, we tapped the expertise of Alexandra Uritis, event design, and proposal planner. The Yes Girls. Ahead, Uritis weighs in on 10 things you can\u2019t forget to do before you get down on one knee, as well as four tidbits to keep in mind once you're actually putting your romantic plan into action.", "Meet the Expert", "Alexandra Uritis is an event design and proposal planner for the OG professional proposal planning company, The Yes Girls.", "This might seem obvious, but before you start plotting, it\u2019s important to make sure you both have marriage on the brain. Talk to your partner about the future. Let them know that one day you\u2019d like to be married, and ask if they see marriage in their future, too. Nervous about making this conversation feel too much like a proposal? Keep it broad by discussing your best friend\u2019s recent engagement, and lead into it that way. Is it a hard conversation? Yes. But hopefully, you\u2019ll come away from it with an idea of what your partner will say when you open that ring box.", "Old school? Yes. Important? Also yes (depending on the family). If your partner has hinted in any way that you need to ask his or her parents for their hand in marriage, do it. That doesn\u2019t mean your partner is anyone\u2019s property, though. Try something like this: \u201cI am deeply in love with your son/daughter, and we want to spend our lives together. I am planning to propose, and want you to be involved in this exciting moment.\u201d", "The engagement ring is a piece of jewelry your partner will be wearing every day for the rest of their life, so get a sense of what they\u2019ll really love. Snap photos of the jewelry they wear every day, take a peek at their secret Pinterest board, or ask a close friend or family member to help you narrow it down. As for jewelers, get some recommendations (or see if there\u2019s a friend or family member in the biz who you should talk to) to make sure you\u2019re purchasing from a trusted store with great reviews and service. Last but certainly not least, investigate their ring size. If it\u2019s not a secret, just ask. If you\u2019re going the surprise route, check your partner\u2019s jewelry. Find a ring that he or she wears regularly (and make a note of which finger it goes on), then either bring it with you to a jeweler or mark how far it fits on your own finger. Many jewelers can also make a good guess at a ring size based on your partner\u2019s height and weight. And there\u2019s always resizing.", "Now that you have a ring, it\u2019s time to plan the proposal. Think about the type of proposal your partner will love, whether it\u2019s a grand gesture, an intimate moment, or a surprise surrounded by family and friends. No matter your budget, Uritis says to first hone in on a beautiful, sentimental spot, which you can easily glamorize to set the mood. \"Find a cool space that means something to them\u2014it can just be your cozy living room, but you deck it out with tons of candles and it completely changes the feel of the space, and you can make it special to them,\" she advises. Earn major points with personalization, too, and steer clear of one-size-fits-all ideas.", "You know your love best, but sometimes it's worth it to outsource for a bit of extra proposal help. Companies like The Yes Girls take care of everything from logistics to sourcing vendors\u2014just know that such a luxury will cost you. With thousands of proposals under their belts, these planners know a thing or two about making your bent-knee milestone all the more memorable, and most importantly, worry-free. \"You can stay calm and collected and enjoy this time because it\u2019s a huge moment for you, too,\" Uritis says. \"We can do all the backend things so you can take all the credit and look fabulous.\"", "You don\u2019t need to have your speech totally written out, but spend a little time jotting down what you\u2019d like to say. Getting your thoughts on paper will give you some direction when it\u2019s time to pop the question, even if you end up winging half of it anyway. As for what to say when you actually propose, Uritis's clients typically hit on their partner's best qualities, or even recap the moment they knew their S.O. was the one. \"It\u2019s just really being genuine and making [them] feel so loved and excited in that moment,\" she adds. \"And it can be short\u2014it can be a couple of sentences. But talking about what they love about them and how excited they are for their future together would be the two best things to bring up.\" Of course, don't forget to tack on the \"Will you marry me?\" bit.", "You don\u2019t need to plan a full-on engagement party, but make sure you\u2019ve got an idea of how the two of you will celebrate the big moment. Book a table at your favorite restaurant, tuck some champagne in the fridge, or have a few friends waiting in the wings.", "Really read into your partner's personality to determine whether a private one-on-one celebration or a full-fledged family affair would make them feel the most comfortable.", "Life happens, so be prepared to go with the flow. Don\u2019t rush the proposal just because the sun is about to set or dinner is nearly over\u2014wait until the moment really feels right. And if you\u2019ve planned something a little more low-key, that very well might mean waiting a few days if your sweetheart is stressed from work or the weather isn\u2019t cooperating.", "To avoid blowing the surprise, come up with a foolproof ruse that leads your S.O. off track a bit. They may know something's up, especially if you're taking a trip or have out-of-the-ordinary plans, but a fake game plan \"keeps the proposer calm if he or she feels they're really insecure in this 'lie,'\" Uritis says.", "From the second you have the ring in your hands, keep it safe. Invest in insurance right away, then find a safe place to hide the ring until it\u2019s time. When you\u2019re ready to propose, safety is still key. Make sure the ring is secure in a zipped pocket or safely in the box\u2014somewhere you\u2019ll be able to reach easily without dropping it.", "Nothing ruins the spontaneity faster than your partner seeing the bulge of a ring box from your pocket. To save the day, The Yes Girls actually invented the ultimate proposal hack: the Box Sock. This wearable accessory comes with a small pocket and tiny ring box, ready for immediate retrieval as soon as you stoop down to one knee.", "Whether you hire a professional or trust your future sister-in-law and her iPhone, your soon-to-be fianc\u00e9(e) will love you all the more for finding someone to document the occasion. If they have no idea the proposal's coming, you can expect absolutely epic reaction snapshots. In fact, Uritis highly recommends that her clients book a photographer, \"especially in this day and age when you do it for the \u2018gram and they have these gorgeous pictures to announce that they're engaged.\" Bonus: You can even double down for an impromptu engagement shoot.", "Take a deep breath, get down on one knee, and pitch the sentimental speech you've probably rehearsed a million times. According to Uritis, it really doesn't matter which knee you go down on, but if you've stashed the ring in your sock, then kneel on the opposite side.", "After you've asked for your partner's hand in marriage, let them have a moment. Ample time must be given to process/cry/hug it out. Then, once they've collected themselves, read the situation to figure out when to officially put on the ring.

The general\nidea can be for example a love story photo session in beautiful places on the\nisland. The bride relaxes after the first location in our route and doesn\u2019t\nexpect any surprises. And the groom, as agreed, gives us a signal \u2013 a phrase or\na special sign \u2013 and we understand what is going to happen. At this moment, our\nfaces don\u2019t show any new emotion, and the bride and groom are the focal points.\nEven if the bride is suspecting something, she\ndoesn\u2019t know that the proposal will happen at this exact moment.

Another option is for the videographer to lead and the photographer to get cues and not to intervene. One more scenario is to work with the lenses of different focal lengths. The photographer can have ones of 70-200 mm and work from far, and the videographer 24-70 mm and be close. You need to have a directional microphone, no in-built ones.

If you can integrate your history as a couple into that proposal, it is unbelievable what it does for your brain, your memory, your future together. It\u2019s the foundation for your future.\u201d", "Meanwhile, the brides and grooms-to-be aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit from these luxury services. Demaree\u2019s clients have an average budget between $40,000 and $50,000 (though some have reached the six- and even seven-figure mark), and a portion of the proceeds from every sale go to the Los Angeles Food Bank. The company has also partnered with the Women\u2019s Global Empowerment Fund, an organization dedicated to ending child marriage in Uganda and providing women and girls with better educational and economic opportunities.", "\u201cIt adds another level of purpose to what I do,\u201d says Demaree. \u201cWhen people fall in love and they take this step with me, their love for each other is a gift of love to another child.\u201d", "Suggested for you", "News, advice and insights for the most interesting man in the room.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Sign up for InsideHook to get our best content delivered to your inbox every weekday.
