This can lead to breakdowns, and can sometimes even be a threat to driver safety.", "To help mechanics and consumers alike, automobile manufacturers sometimes issue either a technical service bulletin (TSB) or a recall notice. While these are both meant to contribute to the goal of helping keep cars in good running shape, they are intended for different audiences, and can ultimately result in different outcomes.", "Here\u2019s what you should know about how recall notices differ from technical service bulletins.", "Most car buyers will never see a technical service bulletin. That\u2019s because these documents are issued to mechanics instead of to car owners, and are meant to be used as tools for diagnosing problems in a car. A TSB will indicate that a specific part in a model may be faulty, and list the steps mechanics should take to correct the problem. If you work at a garage after auto mechanic training, you\u2019ll likely find TSBs to be a great shortcut for figuring out what might be wrong with a given car.", "Recall notices, on the other hand, are sent directly to car owners. They indicate that a particular problem exists with a car model, and that owners must bring their vehicle in for servicing to address that problem.", "When a recall is issued, car owners can bring their vehicle in to an appropriate dealer for free servicing to correct the problem. Because recalls target specific groups of cars, the age and condition of the vehicle has no bearing on whether a car is eligible for recall. It\u2019s not uncommon for recalls to be issued for cars that are several years old.", "A TSB can result in a free repair, but only if the car in question is within the warranty period, and possibly only if the customer goes to a dealership. Should the failure occur outside of the warranty, the owner themselves will be on the hook.", "", "Recalls result in free repairs, but TSBs might not", "", "Because TSBs are essentially instructions for dealing with a problem or problems arising from faulty components, they always deal directly with the mechanical functioning of a car. A recall notice, on the other hand, can be issued for reasons other than a mechanical defect. Among other things, recalls have been issued for improper labelling in a car, or incorrect glazing of windshields. While these can be problems in certain situations, they likely won\u2019t have much effect on the average person\u2019s driving experience.", "In some of these non-urgent circumstances, recall notices are issued that do not require that the car be returned to a dealership for servicing. Rather, they might recommend that the owner of the vehicle have the problem addressed whenever they next see their mechanic for servicing.

Preventive maintenance is also a fundamental part of a mechanic's job, but this is not possible in the case of vehicles that are not regularly maintained by a mechanic. One misunderstood aspect of preventive maintenance is scheduled replacement of various parts, which occurs before failure to avoid far more expensive damage. Because this means that parts are replaced before any problem is observed, many vehicle owners will not understand why the expense is necessary.", "With the rapid advancement in technology, the mechanic's job has evolved from purely mechanical, to include electronic technology.

While it's not required by law for a mechanic to be certified, some companies only hire or promote employees who have passed ASE tests. The technology used in automobiles changes very rapidly and the mechanic must be prepared to learn these new technologies and systems.  The auto mechanic has a physically demanding job, often exposed to extreme temperatures, lifting heavy objects and staying in uncomfortable positions for extended periods. They also may deal with exposure to toxic chemicals.", "The internet is being applied to the field increasingly often, with mechanics providing advice on-line. Mechanics themselves now regularly use the internet for information to help them in diagnosing and/or repairing vehicles. A popular resource for this type of research is the video website YouTube, where professional and DIY mechanics alike film and share their experiences on vehicle diagnostics and repair. Paper based service manuals for vehicles have become significantly less prevalent with computers that are connected to the Internet taking their position, giving quick access to a plethora of technical manuals and information.\nIn addition  online appointment platforms have surged allowing customers to schedule vehicle repairs by making appointments. A newer method of mobile mechanic services has emerged where the  online appointment made by a person seeking repairs turns into a dispatch  call and the mechanics travel to the customers location  to perform the services.", "A mechanic usually works from the workshop in which the (well equipped) mechanic has access to a vehicle lift to access areas that are difficult to reach when the car is on the ground. Beside the workshop bound mechanic, there are mobile mechanics like those of the UK Automobile Association (the AA) which allow the car owner to receive assistance without the car necessarily having to be brought to a garage.[1]", "A mechanic may opt to engage in other careers related to his or her field. Teaching of automotive trade courses, for example, is almost entirely carried out by qualified mechanics in many countries.", "There are several other trade qualifications for working on motor vehicles, including panel beater, spray painter, body builder and motorcycle mechanic.  In most developed countries, these are separate trade courses, but a qualified tradesperson from one can change to working as another.  This usually requires that they work under another tradesperson in much the same way as an apprentice.", "Auto body repair involves less work with oily and greasy parts of vehicles, but involves exposure to particulate dust from sanding bodywork and potentially toxic chemical fumes from paint and related products.  Salespeople and dealers often also need to acquire an in-depth knowledge of cars, and some mechanics are successful in these roles because of their knowledge. Auto mechanics also need to stay updated with all the leading car companies as well as new launching cars. One has to study continuously on new technology engines and their work systems.", "Pit crews for motor racing are a specialized form of work undertaken by some mechanics.  It is sometimes portrayed as glamorous in movies and television and is considered prestigious in some parts of the automotive industry.  Working in a pit crew in professional racing circuits is potentially dangerous and very stressful work due to the tight margins for error, and the potential financial losses and gains by the racing teams, but a pit crew mechanics pay is usually high to reflect the extra skill/stress levels.[2]"]], "https://www.moneycrashers.com/diy-car-maintenance-tips-checklist/": [{"h1": ["Money Crashers", "8 DIY Car Maintenance Tips You Can Handle \u2013 Checklist"], "h2": ["Recent Stories", "1.
