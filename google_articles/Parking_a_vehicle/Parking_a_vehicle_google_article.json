Align it in such a manner that there\u2019s a minimum one arm\u2019s distance between the two cars. However, this distance depends on the length of your car, the available space and the turning radius of your car. So one arm distance is the least, but do not spare more than half of your car\u2019s width between your car and the car parked in front. Some would recommend aligning the rear wheels of your car with the rearmost part of the adjacent parked car. And some insist on aligning the mirrors of your car and the parked car in a way that they are adjacent to each other from the driver\u2019s point of view.

The parking spot should be on your left, so lock the steering to the extreme left (and vice-a-versa if in case it is on the right). Engage the reverse gear, check the mirrors, and start backing up. You\u2019d need to keep an eye out to the car at the back through the IRVM, and the rearmost part of the car parked ahead as well. It is recommended to look over your shoulder towards where your car is reversing in by shifting in your seat and holding the passenger side seat for better support. Keep reversing until the front wheels of your car are aligned with the rearmost part of the front car, although it could be difficult to judge this at first from the driver\u2019s seat. But while at it, keep looking into your driver side ORVM, and you should see the entire front of the car parked behind.", "Things to look out for in Step 2-", "The next move is to turn your steering wheel back into the middle position. Keep reversing as the rear of your car starts approaching the pavement and the rear parked car while the nose of your car is clear of the front car.

So that space by the front door is ideal, unless you have to circle back three times to get it. In order to reduce the time spent driving around the lot AND walking across it, the efficient driver must decide whether to go for the close space, quickly park further out, or settle for something in-between.", "\"Mathematics allows you to make intelligent decisions,\" Redner says. \"It allows you to approach a complex world with some insights.\"", "In their paper, Krapivsky and Redner map three simple parking strategies onto an idealized, single row parking lot. Drivers who grab the first space available follow what the authors call a \"meek\" strategy. They \"waste no time looking for a parking spot,\" leaving spots near the entrance unfilled. Those who gamble on finding a space right next to the entrance are \"optimistic.\" They drive all the way to the entrance, then backtrack to the closest vacancy. \"Prudent\" drivers take the middle path. They drive past the first available space, betting on the availability of at least one other space further in. When they find the closest space between cars, they take it. If no spaces exist between the furthest parked car and the entrance, prudent drivers backtrack to the space a meek driver would have claimed straightaway.", "Despite the simplicity of the three strategies, the authors had to use multiple techniques to compute their relative merits. Oddly enough, the meek strategy mirrored a dynamic seen in the microtubules that provide scaffolding within living cells. A car that parks immediately after the furthest car corresponds to a monomer glomming on to one end of the microtubule. The equation that describes a microtubule's length\u2014 and sometimes dramatic shortening\u2014 also described the chain of \"meek\" cars that accumulate at the far end of the lot.", "\"Sometimes there are connections between things that seem to have no connection,\" Redner says. \"In this case, the connection to microtubule dynamics made the problem solvable.\"", "To model the optimistic strategy, the authors wrote a differential equation. Once they began to mathematically express the scenario, they spotted a logical shortcut which greatly simplified the number of spaces to consider.", "The prudent strategy, according to Redner, was \"inherently complicated\" given the many spaces in play. The authors approached it by creating a simulation that allowed them to compute, on average, the average density of spots and the amount of backtracking required.", "So which strategy is best? As the name suggests, the prudent strategy. Overall, it costs drivers the least amount of time, followed closely by the optimistic strategy. The meek strategy was \"risibly inefficient,\" to quote the paper, as the many spaces it left empty created a lengthy walk to the entrance.", "Redner acknowledges that the optimization problem sacrifices much real-world applicability in exchange for mathematical insight.

This type of car parking fits more cars per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking, and is therefore commonly used in car parking lots and car parking structures.", "Often, in car parking lots using perpendicular parking, two rows of parking spaces may be arranged front to front, with aisles in between. If no other cars are blocking, a driver may perform a \"pullthrough\" by driving through one parking space into the connecting space to avoid having to reverse out of a parking space upon their return.", "Sometimes, a single row of perpendicular car parking spaces is marked in the center of a street. This arrangement eliminates reversing from the manoeuvre; cars are required to drive in forwards and drive out forwards.", "", "Angle parking, known as echelon parking in Britain, is similar to perpendicular parking for these vehicles, except that cars are arranged at an angle to the aisle (an acute angle with the direction of approach).  The gentler turn allows easier and quicker parking, narrower aisles, and thus higher density than perpendicular parking.  While in theory the aisles are one-way, in practice they are typically wide enough to allow two cars to pass slowly when drivers go down the aisles the wrong way.", "Angle parking is very common in car parking lots.  It may also be used in streetside car parking in the U.S. when there is more width available for car parking than would be needed for parallel parking of cars, as it creates a larger number of parking spaces.  Some cities have utilized angled parking on-street (as compared to off-street parking facilities).  This has been done mostly in residential, retail and mixed use areas where additional parking compared to parallel parking is desired and traffic volumes are lower.  Most angled parking is design in a head-in configuration while a few cities (Seattle, Portland, Baltimore, and Indianapolis are examples) have some back-in angled parking (typically on hills or low traffic volume streets).", "Angle parking is considered dangerous by cycling organisations, especially in the head-in configuration, but unwelcome in either form. When comparing to parallel parking:", "Hence organisations such as the Cyclists Touring Club are usually opposed to all proposed echelon parking schemes, though there are some alternatives, such as back-in angle parking (slanted the \"wrong\" way, with the driver reversing into the space, rather than reversing out), which can overcome many of the issues of safety.", "Besides these basic modes of motor vehicle parking, there are instances where a more ad hoc approach to arranging motor vehicles is appropriate.  For example, in parts of some large cities, such as Chicago and Bangalore, where land is expensive and therefore parking space is at a premium, there are formal and informal parking lots for motor vehicles where the driver leaves the keys to the vehicle with an attendant who arranges vehicles so as to maximize the number of vehicles that can be parked in the lot.  Vehicles may be packed up to five vehicles deep in combinations of perpendicular and/or parallel parking with limited circulation aisles for the parking attendant.  Such arrangements are known as attendant parking. When the lot or facility is provided to serve the customers of a business, it is considered valet parking.", "Inner city parking lots are often temporary, the operators renting land which is vacant pending the construction of a new office building.  Some inner city lots are equipped with individual lifts, allowing cars to be stored above each other.", "Another ad hoc arrangement is tandem parking.  This is sometimes done with residential motor vehicle parking where two motor vehicles park nose-to-end in tandem.  The first motor vehicle does not have independent access, and the second motor vehicle must move to provide access. As with attendant parking, the purpose is to maximize the number of motor vehicles that can park in a limited space. Formalised tandem parking will sometimes be sanctioned by local planning authorities for staff parking arrangements require additional parking in limited spaces.", "In parking lots (car parks in British English), parking is allowed only where marked.[3]", "In the US, minimum width standards of parking spaces usually range from 8.5\u00a0to 9.0 feet (2.6\u20132.7\u00a0m). Angled and perpendicular spaces may need to be wide to allow doors to open, while parallel parking spots may be narrower on low-traffic neighborhood streets.", "Because the boundary between parking space and driving area is not always well-defined, the length of a parking space is more difficult to establish.  However, most angled and perpendicular spaces are considered to be between 10 and 18 feet (3.0\u20135.5\u00a0m) in length.  In the United States, due to vehicles being larger on average than some other countries[citation needed], a parking space 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) deep is uncommon and most parking spaces will be within 16\u00a0to 20 feet (4.9\u20136.1\u00a0m), with 19 feet (5.8\u00a0m) feet deep being the standard DOT recommended depth for standard perpendicular parking[citation needed].

This class of crashes, non-traffic, was limited to incidents occurring outside public trafficways, typically driveways and parking facilities.Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed in backover collisions. Non-profit organization Kids & Cars reported that 25 children in the U.S. were killed in 2019 due to backover incidents alone.In a move to change these numbers, NHTSA previously ruled that all new vehicles under 10,000 pounds (including passenger vehicles, buses and trucks) had to be equipped with rear visibility technology. To further promote safety, late last year, NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to seek public input on replacing mirrors on heavy trucks and cars with camera-based, rear-visibility systems.", "Many companies have incorporated reverse parking into their corporate safety policies. Not only can this improve driver and pedestrian safety, but it can also help save costs.With telematics, companies can monitor whether their drivers are following company rules. In MyGeotab, for example, fleet managers can set up a safety rule for backing up when leaving. This rule identifies drivers who back out their vehicles when leaving a location. The system can send a notification for when the rule is broken, either by email, popup, beep warning, or text message.Fleet managers can use these insights to help drivers define their strengths and weaknesses, and to set up a customized driver coaching program if necessary.", "Myth #1: Reverse parking disrupts traffic more than forward parkingWhile reverse parking may disrupt traffic flow, the alternative \u2014 backing out of a parking space \u2014 is also disruptive and hazardous.

The result was AppyParking", "Few sources of inspiration are as potent as that of frustration and the lightbulb moment that lead to the creation of AppyParking, the parking-payment and information app, is no exception. \u201cThe idea came about when I was trying to park outside the Royal Albert Hall to go to a gig,\u201d says Dan Hubert, founder and CEO of the startup. Unfortunately the parking bays were full and the information about alternative places to put his car were scant. \u201cNot ideal,\u201d Hubert says. \u201cIt was then that I thought something had to be done about this awful lack of communication between council and drivers.\u201d", "However, doing something about Britain\u2019s broken parking system would prove a bigger challenge than expected. Just as for many other startups in the transportation sector, one the biggest hurdles to overcome was accessing data to start building his platform, which was made more difficult because there was no public-parking database he could access. \u201c[It was then] I realised the magnitude of my vision,\u201d he says. But rather than giving up, he doubled down and went to work. For months he pulled information off local authorities\u2019 websites, deciphered hand-drawn maps and created a map of London\u2019s parking spaces. \u201cI then had to individually draw and digitise over 1,800 parking zones and input every parking restriction across all bay types.\u201d", "Moreover, Hubert quickly realised how much patience would be required to get his solution off the launchpad. \u201c[The] transportation and mobility space is very startup-unfriendly,\u201d he says. Indeed, any entrepreneur operating in the sector has to be ready to deal with local councils, regulators, established transport companies and manufacturers. Additionally, you also have to woo the public opinion. \u201cAll these things are naturally slow-moving and adverse to change, which is the antithesis of startup principles,\u201d Hubert says.", "To make things even more challenging, he did all this without any help from outside investors. \u201cI bootstrapped the first year with all the savings I had to my name,\u201d he says. \u201cThings got tight toward the end of the first year so I decided to sleep on my friend\u2019s sofa and let out my flat on Airbnb to make ends meet.\u201d Fortunately, things looked up in 2015 when he raised a seed round through the Microsoft Accelerator London, the VC firm Rosemont Group Capital Partner and through three angel investors. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve raised two additional seed rounds for \u00a31m and \u00a32.25m respectively and we\u2019ll be going for a series A in Q1 2018,\u201d he says. In total, AppyParking has raised $4.5m to date.", "Thanks to these injections of capital and his own perseverance, the startup has grown significantly. \u201cThe company has been through a lot of changes and we\u2019re now a team of 18 people,\u201d Hubert says. But he\u2019s not taking his foot off the accelerator anytime soon and is planning to grow the team to 80 people by early 2019. \u201c[It] will be a huge transition,\u201d he says.", "And people are sitting up and paying attention. Not only has the startup attracted several big brand partnerships \u2013 including trialling a parking payment system in partnership with the borough of Westminster and Pimlico Plumbers, which saved the latter more than \u00a3100,000 in parking fines \u2013 but the startup has also been recognised in several business awards. \u201cThe recognition is great as parking is so much more than just parking,\u201d he says. By winning things like the European Startup Prize for Mobility award and being named Best British Mobile Startup by KPMG, Hubert hopes to raise awareness about what still needs to be done. \u201cEvery metre of kerbside needs to be addressed beyond parking bays and if we are to manage the future of connected cars correctly,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are some very obvious virtual roadblocks that need [to be] resolved in order to be able to open up new opportunities and business models within the intelligent mobility revolution.", "And there\u2019s no doubt that AppyParking is aiming to do its bid to make this happen. \u201cIt\u2019s our mission to make parking truly forgettable by powering connected and driverless vehicles with HD kerbside navigation and automated payments,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThis requires huge belief, energy, support and focus. So for me and my team, it\u2019s a case of keeping our head down and cracking on and solving a huge problem at a time.\u201d", "As web editor and resident Viking, Johansson ensures EB is filled with engaging and eclectic entrepreneurial stories.

Parallel parking usually requires initially driving slightly past the parking space, parallel to the parked vehicle in front of that space, keeping a safe distance, then followed by reversing into that space. Subsequent position adjustment may require the use of forward and reverse gears.", "Parallel parking is considered to be one of the hardest skills for new drivers to learn and is a required part of most driving tests. Parallel parking enables the driver to park a vehicle in a smaller space than would be true of forward parking. Driving forward into a parking space on the side of a road is typically not possible unless two or more successive parking spaces are empty. Reversing into the spot via the parallel parking technique allows one to take advantage of a single empty space not much longer than the car (in order to complete the parking within three wheel-turns the parking space would generally need to be about one and a half car-length long).", "New drivers learn to use reference points to align themselves in relation to the car in front of the space, to determine the proper angle for backing, and to determine when to turn the steering wheel while backing. They may find it easier to briefly stop at each reference point and turn for the next step.", "Two major types of parallel parking technique differ in whether they will use two or three positions of the steering wheel while backing. A skilled driver is theoretically able to parallel park by having their car move along two arcs, the first having its center on the parking side of the car and the second having its center on the other side. There will be a point in the transition between these curves where all the car's wheels will be parallel with each other. Less-confident drivers may choose to drive further while transitioning, making it a pronounced middle step of three. Such a step allows greater tolerances to avoid hitting anything, but forces the car to start further from the road's edge and requires more space to the rear.", "In the early 21st century, car manufacturers are addressing this need by introducing automatic parking.", "Roads that facilitate parallel parking have an extra lane or a large shoulder for parked cars. It is also employed whenever parking facilities are not available\u2014usually in large metropolitan areas where there is a high density of vehicles and few (or restricted) accommodations such as multi-storey car parks.", "Many traffic regulators restrict parallel parking during rush hour, freeing up an extra traffic lane.  Historically, metered parallel parking had individual meters for each parking spot with spots clearly marked on the road.  Some regulators have eliminated individual spots allowing shorter vehicles to use less space.  Individual meters are then also replaced with a centralized parking ticket machine.", "Beyond taking up a lane of traffic, on-street parking further reduces road capacity as remaining traffic slows to interact with cars moving in and out of parallel parking spaces, car doors opening and pedestrians.[1]", "In Japan, there is a ban on on-street parking, with a few exceptions (such as daytime and evening parking)[2][3].

How does one maintain sanity and ensure fair treatment when there are too many cars and not enough space? Let\u2019s find out the dos and don\u2019ts.", "1. Unofficial parkingIf you own a vehicle, you\u2019re eligible for a parking space or stilt (usually one or two according to your BHK size). Members are seen parking more than vehicles than allowed in their allotted space/s. For example, the husband already owns a car and parks in his usual spot.
