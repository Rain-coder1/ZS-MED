The discipline, developed in France beginning in the late 1980s, was popularized through Internet videos, television commercials, and documentary and feature films, including the James Bond movie Casino Royale (2006).", "Writers on parkour trace its origins to the physical education and training methods developed beginning in the years before World War I by Georges H\u00e9bert and known as \u201cla m\u00e9thode naturelle.\u201d The regimen involved training in running, jumping, climbing, balancing, swimming, and defending and the use of obstacle courses called \u201cparcours du combattant.\u201d H\u00e9bert\u2019s system came to underpin French military training. Later, during the 1940s and \u201950s, Raymond Belle received instruction on H\u00e9bert\u2019s methods while in the military, and he subsequently used that training to become an elite firefighter. He was known for his acrobatic athleticism and ability to safely and quickly move along ledges, to scale buildings without using a ladder, and to leap between building rooftops. His son David Belle is generally credited as being the father of parkour.", "David trained with his father, and he and a group of friends began practicing parkour on their own, adding their own challenges and movements and calling themselves the Yamakasi. By the late 1990s the Yamakasi were giving public performances. With increasing visibility, Belle and another leading member of the group, S\u00e9bastien Foucan, began to disagree about the direction the new discipline should take, and they both left the group. Foucan introduced the movement in Britain, where it was called freerunning.", "Parkour spread to dozens of other countries, where national and local organizations were formed, mostly for the purpose of providing training and education. While some theorists opposed the idea of competition in parkour, the international organizations World Freerunning Parkour Federation (2008), F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Arts du D\u00e9placement (FIADD; 2012), and Mouvement International du Parkour, Freerunning et l\u2019Art du D\u00e9placement (founded by Belle, Foucan, and others in 2014) were established, each aimed at creating a structure for worldwide parkour competitions.

This is unfortunate because they shared fundamental principles of generating and redirecting momentum. A better understanding of these can benefit all of these activities.", "One impressive feat that catches the eye of many parkour observers is the way traceurs run up high walls to get onto buildings.", "To climb high structures, parkour athletes run toward the wall and then kick off it with one (or more) contacts. This technique allows them to reach much higher than using a standing vertical jump, and also allows them to keep moving efficiently through the urban environment.", "To investigate how athletes accomplish this wall run efficiently we embedded a force plate in the ground and a second force plate in the wall. We then filmed study participants as they approached the wall.", "We watched how the athletes redirected their body by using a consistent transition strategy that depended on specific actions of the legs on the floor and wall.", "Although some parkour guides recommend athletes straddle the floor and wall simultaneously, we did not observe this \u2013 the traceurs always left the floor before they contacted the wall.", "We wanted to better understand the most efficient foot placement on the ground and the wall, and the effect of different approach speeds. So we built a computer simulation that could optimise each.", "The model corresponded well with what we observed \u2013 an intermediate run-up speed is best \u2013 and allowed us to understand why.", "During the run up you create horizontal momentum (the product of speed and body weight). Some of this horizontal momentum can be redirected into vertical momentum at take-off by keeping the leg on the ground rigid \u2013 a bit like a pole vault with a rigid pole.", "If the approach run is slow there is less horizontal momentum to transfer to vertical momentum. Then the take-off leg has to create vertical momentum by using the leg muscles \u2013 which is less efficient.", "With a very fast run-up, the take-off leg must act as a shock absorber, which wastes energy and wipes out the benefits of a faster approach.", "So, traceurs naturally select an intermediate run-up speed, allowing them to use the least amount of energy to scale the wall.", "To scale higher walls a faster approach may be required, but this also requires an ability to generate sufficient leg force. Greater speed does provide greater momentum but it also reduces the time available for the leg to generate the impulse (the product of force and time) necessary to scale the wall.", "What goes up must come down!", "Our research on jumping off walls shows that the type of landing that traceurs choose is influenced by their height, body mass, and leg power.", "Landing safely involves managing a number of different forces. Imagine you step or jump off an object \u2013 your body accelerates due to gravity. Upon landing, your body has a certain momentum that is determined by your weight and your speed. And the higher the object you jump off, the faster your landing speed and vertical momentum prior to landing.", "The main task in landing is to dissipate your momentum in a way in which the load and speed (making up the accumulated energy level) do not exceed biological limits (leading to a muscle tear or tendon rupture).", "The impact of momentum on the landing can be reduced by increasing the time over which landing forces apply.", "For instance, allowing the supporting joints to flex (that is, bend) over a greater range can gradually decrease momentum.", "Alternatively, it is possible to redirect the force by converting momentum into rotational momentum with a roll. This means that force becomes oriented in a direction that does least harm.", "The strategies that are available to an individual vary based on their body characteristics (such as height, weight, bone, joint and muscle strength, flexibility, and coordination). If the chosen strategy is insufficient to manage the momentum, injury to muscles or bones will result.", "Unsurprisingly, through our research we found individuals were more likely to roll when landing from higher drops. Our study subjects (nine men and two women) ranged in height from 1.58-1.87 metres, and in weight from 54\u201392 kg.", "At some heights a two-footed landing is not feasible. But in this study the maximum drop height was only 2.4 m and some traceurs chose not to roll even at this height.", "People with long legs can apply a smaller force over a longer time as they gradually flex their legs to absorb the momentum, and we found evidence that shorter traceurs rolled at lower heights.", "People who weigh a lot have more momentum when dropping from the same height as lighter people. We found this influenced the likelihood of rolling \u2013 heavier athletes were more likely to choose a roll landing when dropping from a lower height.", "Athletes with greater leg power appeared capable of managing impulse absorption through their legs up to a greater drop height. And those with less explosive leg power were more likely to transition to a roll landing at a lower height.", "While you can\u2019t do much about your height, you can change your body mass and leg power through training. In practice, this gives more flexibility because you can select a landing strategy based on the situation rather than having to roll to dissipate momentum.", "Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt in conversation: \"The Web, internet and data during the pandemic: lessons learnt and new directions\"\n          \u2014\n          N/A, Oxfordshire", "Oceans Justice: Lessons from Trade-offs in the Implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 in the Seychelles.\n          \u2014\n          Cardiff, Cardiff [Caerdydd GB-CRD]", "Prof Christophe Fraser & Prof Oliver Pybus in conversation: \"21st century technologies for tackling 21st century pandemics\u201d\n          \u2014\n          Oxford, Oxfordshire", "PONToon Virtual Symposium: Digital Innovation and Female Empowerment\n          \u2014\n          Portsmouth, Hampshire", "Prof Julian Savulescu and Dr Samantha Vanderslott in conversation: \"Mandatory COVID-19 vaccination: the arguments for and against\"\n          \u2014\n          N/A, Oxfordshire", "Copyright \u00a9 2010\u20132020, The Conversation Trust (UK) Limited"]], "https://www.dw.com/en/parkour-freerunning-organizations-resist-figs-efforts-to-usurp-the-sport/a-46531510": [{"h1": ["Parkour freerunning organizations resist FIG's efforts to 'usurp' the sport"], "h2": ["Using war for their sport", "Escaping war", "Artistic talents", "Forgetting 'pain and sorrow'", "Daily life apart from Parkour", "Active on social media too", "Injuries are frequent among the group", "Training on quiet war days", "An extreme parkour run", "An extreme parkour run", "Impressive Skateboard Parkour", "Coronavirus digest: Germany hits record COVID deaths\n30m ago", "Ethiopia: Prime minister urges non-intervention in Tigray conflict\n1h ago", "Reports: Trump eyes pardon for former aide Michael Flynn\n3h ago", "Deutsche Bahn, Siemens launch hydrogen trains trial\n9h ago", "Scotland becomes first country to offer free period products\n10h ago", "DW News on Facebook\n11.07.2017", "Follow @dwnews on Twitter\n11.07.2017"], "h3": [], "h4": ["SPECIAL", "TV programs", "German Courses", "German XXL", "Community D", "Teaching German", "News", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Parkour for freedom in Syria", "Share", "Audios and videos on the topic", "News"], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["We use cookies to improve our service for you.

Aapes also runs submission grappling courses and hosts circus skills workshops, as well as providing a community space where people come to make friends as well as exercise.", "\u201cPeople want parkour to survive,\u201d says JP. \u201cWhen we opened I expected 60 people to show up and more than 500 came.

And most parents know either what it is or at least that they don\u2019t want their kids to do it.\u201d", "Despite perceptions of its dangers \u2013 fuelled in part by videos of extreme routines at dangerous heights \u2013 one reason for its growing popularity is its accessibility to athletes at all levels.

I\u2019ve tried other sports, fitness, learning guitar and languages, but I can\u2019t seem to stick with anything. Parkour is the only thing that\u2019s really made me want to stick to it. I feel like I\u2019m able to reach those goals within myself. I don\u2019t have to compare myself to others. There\u2019s a great sense of achievement.\u201d", "Parkour \u2013 as distinct from free running, which is much more of an expressive discipline \u2013 is not about flips and tricks, or being able to pull off impressive feats of gymnastics on the streets. At its core is a philosophy of self-improvement that validates individual progress above everything, and acknowledges that something that feels ridiculously easy to one person might be incredibly hard to another.", "Fear is as much of a blocker to most traceurs than physical ability. Actually jumping off something tall takes not just strength and technique but also mental discipline: you have to be willing to face your fears and commit to movements, trusting your body\u2019s ability to take you where you want to go.", "\u201cParkour focuses on fear management with a philosophy of being strong to be useful \u2013 strengthening your mind and body to give back to people around you,\u201d says JP, who also teaches the Spear system of self-defence.", "\u201cThe most important thing in self-defence is learning how to deal with fear, fear control and fear management, how to cope with it psychologically and still do things to protect yourself - and you can learn so much more about that from doing parkour than you can from having big men thrown at you.\u201d", "Having done both, I can attest to the truth of that \u2013 the fear of jumping is very real, while fighting people I train with is much less scary. Learning how to deal with what scares you is a crucial part of both disciplines - but not something that comes up regularly in most adults\u2019 lives. Parkour has taught me a lot about myself.", "Some people find it easier to put aside their fear than others; I find it almost impossibly difficult. It would be easy to give up, knowing that even if I manage to conquer my lack of coordination enough to run up a wall, I\u2019d still struggle with the fear of getting down again.", "But every step of the way, thanks to a hugely supportive training group, I\u2019ve found myself acknowledging my terror of losing physical control, understanding my limitations, and \u2013 for the first time in my life \u2013 finding ways to move past them.", "Aapes, as an indoor space, offers nervous beginners a more supportive space than outdoor training. JP says: \u201cWhen someone\u2019s been told their whole life not to move a certain way, outside is very intimidating, and it becomes impossible to get things because there\u2019s no standardisation. Everywhere is different, everything\u2019s a different surface. But if you control it a little more people see that even if they\u2019re not using a crash mat there\u2019s a mat nearby, that brings down their anxiety and they progress much much faster. People are getting stuff in the space now in their first week that took me six months to learn.\u201d", "The community\u2019s support is also a crucial element of the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s not a gym, it\u2019s not just training,\u201d says Monique. \u201cPeople come to make friends and get a sense of community.\u201d", "Those supportive relationships extend outside training spaces. \u201cEveryone knows everyone and everyone travels \u2013 you do it for more than six months and you\u2019ll have ties to people all over the place,\u201d JP says.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no deception in movement and no competition in movement.

Traceurs visiting foreign countries stay with each other, train together and find themselves discovering new cities through the eyes of people who know them intimately.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to go to a city and, even though you\u2019re still a tourist, to go somewhere and be shown these spots that not even most of the locals know about,\u201d says Monique. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know about these beautiful spaces that are tucked away. You feel almost like you can know the city better than its inhabitants \u2013 if you weren\u2019t training you wouldn\u2019t find these places.\u201d", "In return, when overseas traceurs come to Sydney, there\u2019s plenty for them to see in return. JP says: \u201cI didn\u2019t know about Sydney really until I started parkour. All these really beautiful spots with sculpture and fountains \u2013 I didn\u2019t know they existed until people took me to jump off them.\u201d", "The sport tends to get people interested in urban development, as traceurs scope out the potential of new developments as places to train. The Sydney parkour community is currently concerned about potential development at the heritage listed Middlehead Fort, a popular training ground and site for Sydney Parkour\u2019s monthly jams where dozens of traceurs get together and train in the same space. But all sorts of spaces can be used for parkour - it\u2019s hard, once you know what\u2019s possible, to walk down a street without getting distracted by staircases, ledges and other opportunities to leave the well-trodden path.", "\u201cParkour is so popular because it makes ugly things beautiful,\u201d says JP. In desolate urban environments, areas ravaged by conflict, or places consumed by poverty, people use the sport as a way to reclaim their environments and find something beautiful in the spaces they inhabit.", "In the Gaza strip, traceurs do backflips while bombs fall; in Russia, they scale skyscrapers and dice with death on the edge of terrifying drops. In Iran, groups of women have taken to doing parkour in parks, despite the necessity of keeping their hair covered and wearing loose, covering clothing even in the intense heat, finding catharsis in the feeling that nothing can stand in their way.", "At its roots, parkour is as much about helping other people to achieve things as it is about achieving things yourself. I\u2019ve not yet been in a position to do much helping, but I have been on the receiving end of an enormous amount of support, extra coaching, good advice, urgent deliveries of sugary drinks to deal with adrenaline spikes, and help with busting through the things that scare me most.", "This is what makes parkour special to me: when I did, eventually, drop off that high block, for a second it felt like I was flying. And everyone in the room knew how hard I\u2019d worked for it, how it felt to finally face a fear and move past it, and cheered for me as I flew."]], "https://www.shutterstock.com/search/parkour": [{"h1": ["parkour images"], "h2": ["7,980 parkour stock photos, vectors, and illustrations are available royalty-free."], "h3": ["Try these curated collections", "Search for \"parkour\" in these categories"], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": ["Content", "Premium content", "Tools", "For your business", "For contributors", "Our company", "Partner", "Support", "Legal"]}, []], "https://www.thenationalnews.com/lifestyle/enter-the-thrilling-and-daring-world-of-parkour-1.734003": [{"h1": ["Enter the thrilling and daring world of parkour"], "h2": ["Lifestyle", "Lifestyle"], "h3": ["SHARE", "SHARE", "SHARE", "SHARE"], "h4": ["UAE", "WORLD", "BUSINESS", "OPINION", "ARTS&CULTURE", "LIFESTYLE", "SPORT", "VIDEOS", "PODCASTS", "World", "Travel", "World", "Money", "Money", "Home", "Travel", "Lifestyle", "Fashion", "Travel", "Home", "Travel", "Lifestyle", "Fashion", "Travel"], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["Wednesday 25 November 2020", "", "Abu Dhabi", "UAE", "Wednesday Nov 25, 2020", "27\u00b0", "H:27 \u00b0", "L:22 \u00b0", "H:27 \u00b0", "L:20 \u00b0", "H:26 \u00b0", "L:20 \u00b0", "H:26 \u00b0", "L:20 \u00b0", "H:26 \u00b0", "L:20 \u00b0", "H:25 \u00b0", "L:21 \u00b0", "H:24 \u00b0", "L:21 \u00b0", "Abu Dhabi", "EMU", "Wednesday Nov 25,2020", "Abu Dhabi, UAEWednesday 25 November 2020", "May 26, 2018", "May 26, 2018", "Free-running is moving beyond the realms of sport into mass media and politics", "May 26, 2018", "May 26, 2018", "Imagine if you were asked to step across two marks that have been chalked on the floor about a metre apart.

Only, this time, the distance isn\u2019t marked in chalk but is the gap between two buildings and you\u2019re not on the floor but standing 30 metres note-0above the ground. Suddenly, that metre note-1takes on superhuman proportions as you contemplate \u201cleaping\u201d a chasm. And that fear you feel: that is the heartbeat of parkour, one of the note-221st century\u2019s purest yet most controversial art forms.", "You have probably seen parkour (from the French \u201cparcours\u201d meaning \u201ccourse\u201d or \u201croute\u201d) even if you didn\u2019t explicitly know what it was. It also goes by its more familiar name \u201cfree-running\u201d and was devised in France during the 1980s when traditional military obstacle courses were combined with gymnastics. Using a combination of skill, bravery, and questionable legality, practitioners navigate dizzying \u201clines\u201d through urban environments. They scale buildings to run across rooftops and make leaps that should note-3break note-4legs. You might think of it as graffiti for the more aerobically fit.", "Like many things that begin as a subculture, parkour\u2019s note-5styles and attitude have spread into the mainstream. The BBC was one of the first to spot its potential, using it to promote its TV schedule in 2002. In the now infamous ad, note-6the note-7founder of parkour, David Belle, performed a series of unfeasibly high jumps, wall runs, and slides in order to escape his dreary office and to get home to watch his favourite show. As promotions go, it was hugely charming, deceptive, and as cool as skipping school given that the stunts were done across the London skyline to a remix of Dean Martin\u2019s Sway.", "Parkour\u2019s real breakout moment came, however, with the Luc Besson-produced film District 13 in 2004. This time Belle played a detective hunting for a bomb before it destroys part of Paris; a plot that was only really there to hold together a series of spectacular stunts. Parkour clearly suited Besson\u2019s punk-orientated view of the world, having note-8appeared in his Taxi 2 (2000) and Yamakasi (2001).", "Clip from District 13:", "Besson had identified something in the subculture that spoke to wider concerns about urbanisation, privacy, and freedom. Free-running heroes were ultra-chic rebels with runway-model bodies. They accepted no boundaries and ran up, over, and through buildings with no thought to the rules, ownership, or even the physical dangers. It was liberating in a way that movie stunts had never before been. No special effects were needed. It was all about the ingenuity and bravery of the people willing to balance their life on the fine edge of their note-9talent.", "From that moment, the influence of parkour was suddenly everywhere, including the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale, which begins with a quite memorable showcase of the art. It was especially felt in the world of computer games. The two Mirror\u2019s Edge games were pure homage to parkour, which also informed the core mechanic to the Assassin\u2019s Creed series. Pretty soon, any game that involved a character running and scaling objects became a game about parkour.", "Clip from Casino Royale:", "Yet perhaps the greatest advocates of the art remain the free-runners themselves. The names of the collectives might sound strange and exotic \u2013 Speeders, the French Freerun Family, and Team Farang \u2013 but they have huge followings and their videos routinely make it into the mainstream media. In the last decade, free-running has note-10reached note-11the Arab world, with Parkour Gaza using the unique and challenging architecture of the damaged buildings to create a unique and spellbinding aesthetic. From the UK, meanwhile, the team known as Storror is making videos with note-12high production values, including their note-13full-length documentary, Roof Culture Asia, which they have monetisednote-14 through note-15Vimeo.", "Given the rise of parkour and the extent of its appeal, it\u2019s almost disappointing that at some point our admiration for the skills note-16must be qualified by an admission that much of this success has come despite free-running\u2019s strained relationship with the law. In 2009, Moreton, on the Wirral near Liverpool, became the first town in the UK to ban parkour. It was followed by note-17Horsham, West Sussex,note-18 (perhaps unsurprising given that it\u2019s home to Team Storror) and parts of New York.", "For all its undoubted beauty, free-running in its purest form requires a resource that is as abundant as it is problematic. It need walls and rooftops and many of those have owners, occupants, and residents who might not take too kindly to young people note-19leaping on and off them. Parkour has responded by looking to become respectable. Purpose-built venues now exist, and the world championships note-20took place this month note-21in Turkeynote-22. Yet this has done little to mitigate the central problem. Even as it has evolved, parkour has also devolved. Much of this has to do with the way that Youtube has monetised risky, dangerous, and sometimes unlawful behaviour. \u201cParkour\u201d has become a catchall word used to describe both the true artists but also the vandals who use it to justify all kinds of trespass.", "The problem is, of course, a problem for YouTube whose success has been built upon the back of questionable videos that could not have been made by orthodox note-23means. Commercial producers would not invest in projects based around \u201cfreighthopping\u201d where \u201cadventurers\u201d ride across the US or Canada in the note-24gaps between wagons. Nor could they afford the huge legal bills was would result if they encouraged \u201cfree climbers\u201d who illegally climb some of the highest structures \u2013 towers, cranes, and chimneys \u2013 in order to post note-25videos shot from the top.", "___________________", "Read more:", "Palestinians practise parkour on Gaza-Israel border", "Learning about the art of calisthenics from the world\u2019s leading practitioners in Dubai", "My UAE: Jumping for joy with Emirati parkour coach Amal Murad", "___________________", "Parkour\u2019s success has certainly been helped by its somewhat outlaw nature, but it also has a better record than many of the other extreme sports. Parkour practitioners are quick to claim what they do isn\u2019t criminal (trespass is usually considered a civil matter) and argue that they leave buildings exactly as they found them. Critics respond by arguing that it\u2019s a misnomer to assume damage isn\u2019t done when feet land where feet were never meant to land. Trespass also takes on a different level of significance when transported to other cultures. What once seemed like youthful arrogance when filmed in London or New York takes on the characteristics of colonial excess when done in India or South America. How does one begin to moralise about art when it involves rich Westerners running on the homes of people whose yearly incomes are far less than the price of the drone being used to film those runs?", "Cultural sensitivities might not always be foremost in the free runners\u2019 minds, but that is part of the challenge they now face. Parkour at its best can represent a vehicle for a very modern and forward-looking world view. Many of the teams are advocates for their art and sport. They teach it in schools in some of the poorest communities. As free-runner Chris Hayes-Kossmann memorably put it: \u201cOne of the main points of the philosophy behind parkour is being able to help people. To teach them note-26to gain confidence in themselves, building up from simple moves to more complex things, to teach them that they are worthwhile people.\u201d", "And it is here that parkour becomes something more than either art or sport. It becomes a political statement. Those seeking to pit their abilities against true risks are expressing something that has been largely removed from much of western culture. Health and Safety initiatives have made life safer, but at what cost? Smoking bans, cleaner air, and now sugar taxes might do a great deal of good but it also breeds a psychology that makes it hard for some to understand that all life involves risk. Parkour is one place where the reward is ultimately the product of avoiding absolute and terminal failure. As note-27Belle has note-28said: \u201cObstacles are found everywhere, and in overcoming them we nourish ourselves\u201d. It\u2019s that nourishment that lies at the heart of what seems from the outside to be crazy and highly note-29irresponsible.", "In seeking to turn the entire world into a park, the free-runners are breaking down more than one kind of obstacle.

Alessandro decided to create a Parkour association with his friends, so that they could have some safe place to train indoors with an insurance. More and more teenagers started to arrive to their place and attend their trainings and from that moment on, they chose to train them. The training methods were based on their own experience and after a while they felt it wasn't enough.\r\nAlthough their experience kept on growing, thanks to teaching and attending to Parkour meetings around France. Alessandro decided to go to Paris and train with the ADD Academy Paris. In May 2014 Alessandro got the permission to open a new academy, so ADD Academy Finist\u00e8re was born.

Alessandro graduated this year with the Sports and Management Degree.", "What about the mental side, how does it affect mind and what skills does it develop?\r\nL\u2019Art Du D\u00e9placement is a complete sport. It develops our mind and spirit through different exercises.\u00a0\r\nWith the Yamak Spirit we learn to:\u00a0\r\n- Treat life as an adventure.\r\n- Respect the body with good nourishment.\r\n- Improve appreciation of our environment.\r\n- Face the unknown.\r\n- Develop a freedom of thought \u00acand learn to act.\r\nThat\u2019s the philosophical point of view we use every day.\r\nYou also learn to recognise and understand fear. Nobody should practice Parkour without fear. Fear is always present, and it reminds you of the riskiness of the movement you are ready to perform. Your head, your conscious, tells you if you are ready for the jump, or not. You may have tried it hundreds of times before, but maybe today you are a little tired or distracted, you learn to know when to act and when to stop.", "Before performing a jump, I always risk-assess it thinking: \u201cokay, it\u2019s windy today, a bit slippery, I should pay attention to my foot placement if I don\u2019t want to fall, etc.\u201d\r\nThis is important because it\u2019s about learning to focus on the move itself instead of showing off. A lot of people, when they start training, they see people looking at them and applauding each successful movement, making them want to push themselves further. It can help you discover your abilities, but without the awareness of fear it is silliness.\r\nOthers don\u2019t like to be watched, for instance sometimes we crawl on the floor or roll, and they don\u2019t want to be teased. In this case the mental training is to learn to cut yourself off from the rest of the world: to practice Parkour for you, not for others.\r\nParkour can also help people face their personal problems as they learn that with each physical object they overcome they have the mental ability to tackle all challenges they encounter. It\u2019s about visualisation and applying the same equality to all obstacles.\r\nWhen training, the mental side is as fundamental to success as the physical. It helps you to discover who you are, what you can do, and also what you can\u2019t do.", "Get the latest news and trends from the fields of playgrounds, sport parks and outdoor furnishing straight to your inbox, monthly.", "We will use your e-mail address in accordance with our EU GDPR compliant Privacy Policy in marketing\u00a0communications \r\nand development of our products as well as services.

There are no leotards and perfect 10.00s. Instead, there's a whole street culture behind it, and you'll see people using buildings, railings, any type of obstacle in their environment to move, ebb, and flow like they're as swift as a breeze. POPSUGAR tapped Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow, former pro parkour athlete for the better part of two decades and founding member of the United States Parkour Association (USPK), and Jesse La Flair, pro parkour athlete and stuntman, for more about this incredible sport.", "Michael told POPSUGAR, \"About 20 years ago in France, that word parkour was born from a bunch of young people who got together and sort of reclaimed this idea of being able to move through your environment the same way people did in the jungles in the past, and running through the woods, but in an urban environment.\" Parkour comes from the French word parcours, meaning \"the way through.\" The \"k\" was substituted in, and like martial arts, Michael said, it's a training discipline.", "David Belle is credited as the inventor of parkour, which you can read about more on the World Freerunning Parkour Federation (WFPF) website. His father was a fireman and veteran who shared with him practices of French military training that are the root of what parkour is today. S\u00e9bastien Foucan, David's friend, is the most well-known person to bring it overseas and is considered the \"father of freerunning,\" according to Michael.", "Parkour is about challenging yourself and pushing yourself to get better, Michael said. \"It really connects with people trying to find their best version of themselves. Even though it's an individual sport, I think it's definitely a group activity built through a great community.\" Jesse echoed that, saying that parkour is about community, but it's also about progressing your skill level. \"So much of what we do is learning how to fall and be comfortable coming out of situations,\" he said. \"I don't ever approach something that scares me. And that is why you see people capable of doing some absolutely absurd, incredible things in our sport because they've practiced and understand what to do when it goes wrong.\"", "The reason athletes gravitate toward the sport is because doing these tricks is relatable, Jesse said \u2014 it's almost reminiscent of playing on a playground as a kid. He also pointed out that the conversation around the sport has grown so much due to social media, movies like Casino Royale (where you see S\u00e9bastien himself actually do parkour as the character Mollaka), and shows such as America Ninja Warrior.", "Parkour and freerunning are often used interchangeably in the media. Parkour is more about moving from point A to point B in the fastest, most efficient way possible, whereas freerunning is adding those tricks and personal flair you've probably seen on YouTube. \"Parkour is really the birthplace of all of those things,\" Michael explained. \"Same way skateboarding used to be riding from one place to another, and then it became hanging out in spots trying to see what you could do, freerunning is an exploration, an expansion of what parkour was. It uses some of the same movements, mentalities, and training disciplines but adds in creative self-expression and freedom of movement, acrobatics, breakdancing, gymnastics . . . a little bit of anything and everything.\"", "\"L'art du d\u00e9placement,\" or \"art du d\u00e9placement,\" is also used as a phrase to describe parkour. Tricking, on the other hand, is a whole other sport altogether, Jesse said. Parkour, freerunning specifically, can use elements of tricking, \"but tricking is derived from martial artists who focused on kicks and punches, and then mixed in flashy or stylistic ways to do it all on flat ground.\" There are no obstacles involved in tricking (i.e. no one flips off of buildings).", "There are different parkour leagues around the world, and Michael explained that in order to be a pro athlete in the US, it's about whether or not you're paying your bills with the sport. \"There are really not a lot of people doing that, but there are a lot of people at that level that are trying to do that,\" he said. Jesse is currently on the Tempest Freerunning professional team, for example. The USPK, Michael's organization, actually offers registration for athletes as professionals based on past competition finishes (right now, you can register as a member, but they're in the process of developing a database for athletes specifically). And while you can train outdoors \u2014 and that's encouraged \u2014 there are indoor facilities as well such as Tempest Academy. To learn more about what it's like to turn pro in the world of freerunning, you can check out Bound by Movement, a documentary that Jesse directed.", "Michael said some parkour competitions are simply about speed where people go head to head and race down the same course. Others are freestyle showcases where judges look at athletes' style. Jesse explained that there are four main categories that freerunning athletes are typically evaluated on: creativity, flow, execution, and difficulty. And, unlike gymnastics, which has the FIG Code of Points where each skill is worth a specific value, parkour does not have a set guide on scoring.", "\"Right now all the freerunning and parkour competitions around the world are totally different because they're all still developing and exploring different ways to score and track this stuff,\" Michael explained. \"That's also being encouraged. They're trying to find ways to explore what people come up with when they aren't restricted to anything other than their imagination.\" Jesse agreed, stating, \"Because it's not very specific movements that you have to do a specific way, it really then becomes painting through space. How difficult would it be to judge a competition of painters who paint very different styles?\" The bigger competitions around the world include the North American Parkour Championships, which just happened in Vancouver, and the Red Bull Art of Motion next month in Matera, Italy.", "Though parkour has grown tremendously as a sport, it's not yet in the Olympics. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), however, has pushed for it to become an Olympic sport. In fact, FIG voted to make parkour one of its official disciplines last December, and it's now listed alongside FIG's gymnastics disciplines on the FIG website. FIG is set to host a Parkour World Championships in 2020, and according to The Guardian, the organization wants to move forward with a plan to bring parkour to the Paris 2024 Games. At this point in time, however, USA Gymnastics, the national governing body for gymnastics, does not have parkour listed as a discipline. \"The FIG recently added parkour under its umbrella, and USA Gymnastics is currently considering options for the best and most efficient way to handle parkour in the USA,\" the organization told POPSUGAR.", "FIG itself told POPSUGAR that it classifies parkour as a FIG discipline, not a gymnastics discipline. \"Parkour has never been developed as 'a gymnastics discipline,'\" the organization said, adding that it has been in development as a FIG discipline since as far back as 2017. \"Parkour is parkour. The FIG is committed to respect parkour's identity and autonomy while supporting its development under the FIG umbrella. The FIG thinks that parkour can benefit from the long experience of the gymnastics disciplines while this urban sport can help bring a fresh perspective on our other sport disciplines.\" You can head over to parkour.sport, the FIG Parkour website, for more information. (Note: there are no US parkour athletes listed on the \"athletes\" page, which is devoted to parkour athletes who have competed in a FIG Parkour World Cup.)", "Michael and Jesse said this topic has hit the parkour community hard with a lot of pushback both due to FIG, a governing body of gymnastics, essentially \"taking over\" parkour, as Michael said \u2014 which you can read more about by looking up #WeAreNotGymnastics on Twitter \u2014 and FIG's plan to introduce parkour at the Olympics following Tokyo 2020. \"The [International] Olympic Committee has connected with the parkour community in the past because they are looking for new and exciting sports, the same way that snowboarding came in and helped revolutionize the Olympics for a younger generation,\" Michael explained. \"They want more of that. They're adding BMX and skateboarding and all sorts of action sports that seem to be successful outside of the Olympics.\"", "Parkour athletes against FIG's \"takeover\" aren't sure if the sport has enough structure scoring-wise to be at the Olympics as of now. \"The main thing with parkour is that there's not really a dedicated competition structure built up on a regional and national level to validate saying, 'OK, we have the same Olympic standards as track and field does,'\" Michael noted. A list of parkour groups who opposed FIG's original vote to take ownership of parkour as one of its disciplines, with the intent of bringing it to the Olympics, can be found on the USPK website.", "Ahead, check out cool footage from the world's top parkour athletes, who, despite the politics, continue to move in ways we never thought possible.

The concrete ground beneath me was perhaps twenty five feet down. My plan was to jump to the other wall from where I stood, clearing the gap.", "At that time I couldn\u2019t make the distance to clear the gap completely and land feet-first on top of the far wall, but I knew I could reach the edge of the wall with my hands and absorb the impact with my legs on the vertical surface of the wall. I knew I was strong enough to hold on and then pull myself up from that position. I knew the wall had a good grip and that it wasn\u2019t raining, so there was no reason I wouldn\u2019t be able to complete the movement safely. I knew a lot of things. So why wasn\u2019t I jumping? This was my first real test in the discipline we call parkour, also known as freerunning, commonly now said to be the fastest growing activity of its kind in the world. Back then, when I began my training, only a handful of people knew what it was and even fewer practised it. This was before the advent of YouTube or parkour becoming de rigueur for every Hollywood action movie and TV commercial; my introduction to it had been fleeting glimpses of the French founders in action and limited discussions via obscure Internet forums, meaning I possessed only a rudimentary understanding of the concepts and philosophy behind the movement. But I knew enough to see there was something there, something truly challenging, something vital to my continued development as an individual. Something unique. My background prior to taking that first that jump had been in the fighting arts and more traditional physical training methods, and I had become fairly competent \u2013 comfortable, even \u2013 in those spheres. I felt that I was strong, fit, coordinated and generally capable in most situations. I was wrong. Or, rather, I was right but only within a very limited paradigm that I was yet to escape from. When I began training in parkour I immediately realised my deficiencies and weaknesses, saw how lacking in capability and simple, natural functionality I was \u2013 not only physically but, far more importantly, mentally as well. The flipside to that realisation is another: that those deficiencies can be overcome, meaning our potential is extraordinarily more vast than most of us ever know.", "", "That little jump was, for me at that time, a real-world test of who I was. I knew I was capable of it, physically, but at the same time it was strikingly clear to me that to undertake and overcome such a challenge would require me to bring all of my abilities \u2013 strength, coordination, focus, timing, courage \u2013 to bear on one single moment, one simple task: to make the jump. This wasn\u2019t just training to do something, this was actually doing that thing. It was different from anything I had experienced in life before. And I loved that.", "So many of our modern-day activities are neutered of any real challenge; diluted, softened, reduced to a lowest common denominator. The cause of that process is, ultimately, fear \u2013 on a societal level. Fear of failure, fear of injury, fear of liability, but always fear. The irony, of course, is that by reducing risk and protecting ourselves from the associated fear, we produce a less capable and more fearful population. Our perception of risk is all wrong. The reality is that by engaging with risk on a regular basis and learning to engage with it and manage it, we massively reduce the less obvious but much greater risks that inevitably do end up causing all the damage: obesity, heart disease, postural problems, stress and all the related ailments of the modern industrialised world.", "Parkour is about reminding yourself that your body and mind are evolved to adapt to, overcome and manage an enormous variety of challenges and testing scenarios, and that in fact the process of doing so is therefore the best way to maintain your health and natural function. Positive stressors, they\u2019re called. Adversity with enormous reward. Risk with benefits.", "It doesn\u2019t take a sport scientist to observe the huge physical benefits of regular movement training. It\u2019s what our bodies are evolved to do, after all \u2013 to run, jump, climb and explore our environment. Parkour will make you stronger, faster, fitter and more agile than you ever thought possible. It\u2019ll give you increased coordination, functional movement skills and problem solving tools that will cross over into every other aspect of your life. However, those things aren\u2019t what drew me in. They aren\u2019t the reasons I finally made that first jump.", "I made that jump to find out who I was. And in that process of self-discovery there is growth, there is improvement, there is transformation. I know now that the person who landed was different \u2013 subtly, but significantly \u2013 from the person who took off. I had gained something, understood something about myself on an experiential level. People don\u2019t climb mountains because they are there, they climb them because something isn\u2019t there: something inside them they seek to find, to know.", "Parkour has given me a way to access that rare gem that lies at the heart of peak experience \u2013 and I don\u2019t need to climb a mountain for it, when it can be found right here on the streets of my own city.", "Interested in finding out more about how you can live better?

Practitioners of parkour work to perfect their ability to leap, grasp, swing, roll, and stride under, over, around, and through any kind of obstacle. Though parkour is primarily practiced in urban environments, the art form is equally applicable in the woods and mountains.", "Parkour was developed in the 1980s by father and son Raymond and David Belle and Sebastien Foucan. Raymond Belle was a French soldier and firefighter who was well-known for his physical fitness and gymnastic prowess. He was a member of an elite team of firefighters who undertook all the most difficult and dangerous rescue missions. The elder Belle was a follower of Georges H\u00e9bert, a French physical fitness instructor who believed that the best way for someone to get fit was to engage in well-rounded, holistic exercise \u2014 running and jumping and diving and swimming and rolling. Mr. Belle tuned his training around this philosophy and inspired many younger firefighters, including his son David, who more formally organized his movements into what is today known as parkour.", "We are big fans of parkour here at MNN, having included it in our list of seven ultra-green extreme sports, and wanted to share more about it with our readers. Enjoy!", "The movements of parkour are probably as old as the human form itself. At its most basic level, parkour is simply a string of efficient and athletic movements that have been practiced, in one form or another, by athletes, warriors, monks, and entertainers stretching back millennia. H\u00e9bert, who could be called the grandfather of parkour, based his exercise philosophy on indigenous tribes he observed in Africa. There\u2019s this film from 1930 showing a daring young man performing moves that would not be out of place in any modern parkour video:", "Parkour is move than just running around the city and swinging on bars \u2014 it's as much the movements as it is the ideals. Parkour traditionalists stress the importance of physical self-reliance and freedom of movement as well as overcoming both physical and mental barriers. Personal growth is paramount. David Belle sees it as training fit for warriors and emphasizes mastering control and focus so as to be able to perform with force and precision. Competition is frowned upon, with some adherents saying that the inclusion of any competitive elements strips the movements of the parkour label.", "Belle gets the credit for formalizing his father's athletic style into what is known as parkour, but like many good philosophies, the tree that began with Belle's parkour has branched out. Belle' friend Foucan developed his own offshoot of parkour known as freerunning that involves more flips and other acrobatic moves. Foucan merged elements of parkour with certain tenets and ideas from martial arts into his philosophy, which he says puts more of an emphasis on the goals and abilities of the individual.", "The 2013 documentary \"Breaking The Line\" does a good job exploring some of the philosophy of parkour as it follows traceur (or parkour enthusiast) Dan Edwardes.", "Parkour is no different from any other style of movement in that it has its own vocabulary of moves.

Here are nine of the best #parkourstrength movements for beginners (in no particular order):", "Harder than a basic push-up, a wall dip is an upper body strength movement that\u2019s highly specific to parkour. Stronger wall dips will also improve movements like vaults and the second half of a climb-up or muscle-up. If you can easily do 8\u201310+ wall dips with good form, begin working on more challenging progressions. If you can\u2019t do a wall dip yet, start with something easier.", "The full ROM air squat is a fundamental movement pattern to master before seriously drilling squatting/jumping/landing skills of greater intensity and complexity.

However, you should still practice good squats, now and for the rest of your life. Keep squatting whether you want to perform better in sport, build a booty, mitigate injury, or simply become a badass 100-year-old human who still moves well.", "In many cases, squatting to hip-below-knee is good enough but you should also develop your full squat. If you can\u2019t squat this low yet, keep working on your mechanics and mobility until your ROM is greater. Make it a point to constantly improve at this basic squat variation but as you get better/stronger, also experiment with deeper ROM, more explosiveness, single-leg variations, adding weight, and jumping/landing.", "Kong-ups are useful for building basic strength/power, as well as full-body coordination. Think of it like a more complex box jump, or a 3-dimensional burpee. A kong-up will bring you to a squatting/standing position on top of an obstacle \u2014 useful as you transition into a jump or run. Be sure to drill this one with a split-foot stance/takeoff as it will carry over better to kong vaults, climb-ups, etc. (versus a feet-together punching takeoff).", "Knees-to-elbows from dead hang is a solid full-body exercise with an application to bar skills that require an explosive knees-to-chest tuck. To improve at underbars, pullovers, kips, and laches, you must learn to lift your legs to your torso by using your abs and hip flexors. Also, this general knees-to-chest movement shows up in many more movements like backflips, vaults, and jumps.", "A strong handstand, in general, is a useful tool for building ground/air awareness. As a beginner, you must spend time working on the wall handstand in order to unlock a quality freestanding handstand. For all levels, wall handstands are an effective way to fine-tune handstand technique and build upper body pushing strength.", "No need to worry about \u201cperfect\u201d form and alignment, unless your goals are something like elite gymnastics or professional circus. For many athletes, it\u2019s more beneficial to focus on developing adaptability and control across many handstand variations and challenges (e.g. handstand walking, up/down stairs, presses, on walls/rails, etc). Start with the wall handstand, and explore outward from here :)", "Broad jumps are one of the most common power tests in sport/athletics, and a keystone movement skill in parkour. Invaluable for leaping across gaps, broad jumps are also a wonderful exercise for developing full-body power.", "Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, and drop into a partial squat while swinging your arms behind you. As you swing your arms forward, explode through your lower body to propel yourself up and forward. Play with different takeoff angles and positions until you find what works best for you.", "While airborne, lift your knees to chest and then extend your feet in front of you, reaching for your goal. On flat ground and with padded shoes/surfaces, heel-striking on the landing can be done in a sustainable way and often results in a farther distance. If barefoot and/or jumping on hard surfaces, you may want to reconsider your landing technique to be less heel heavy and more of a precision landing on the balls of feet.", "Basic/forward quadrupedal movement is a classic full-body movement for general strength training, as well as a practical movement skill to develop. Moving on all four limbs allows you to pass beneath obstacles too low to run beneath, and it\u2019s also useful for transitioning between the ground and more upright positions.", "Start on the ground, supported by your hands and feet, with four points of equal weight distribution. Your butt and head should be around the same height. Advance one hand and the opposite foot at the same time, and then repeat the motion with the other limbs, in a reciprocating pattern.", "Be sure to keep some distance between arms and legs so that your knees don\u2019t run into your elbows when you move. Start slow until you get the hang of the forward motion. Then, gradually speed up your movement. For a different but similar challenge, reverse the motion and do it backward. If performing this movement on hands and feet is too difficult at first, find a soft surface (grass, panel mats, etc.) and try it on hands/knees.", "The standing box jump is one of the most well-known movements in jump training. By jumping onto gradually taller obstacles, you develop general leg power/explosiveness. More specifically, the standing box jump develops vertical jumping power. It also rewards/encourages you to build better squat mobility when pushing your jumps near a max height.", "As a quick injury prevention note, beginners should start on low walls and gradually build up the height with greater strength/skill. Beginners should start with a jump up and then gently climb-down/step-down (the rebounding version is higher impact *and* requires more strength/skill).", "Even advanced athletes may want to consider this step-down/climb-down element when going through phases of low(er)-impact training. Dropping backward from the top and rebounding back up is much higher impact. It\u2019s also a potentially awkward/unrealistic movement to do at max height. If your skill/strength levels aren\u2019t adequate, or if you\u2019re at risk of overtraining from high(er)-impact activity like sport/competition, rebounding box jumps may be a risky training decision.", "While chin-ups have their place in training, pull-ups are more specific to real-world applications like climbing and brachiating (palms-in vs. palms-out). If you already do lots of climbing or parkour, you might want to do more of your strength training with the chin-up style. If you don\u2019t do much upper body pulling in your sport, maybe focus more on pull-ups for the real-world use cases.
