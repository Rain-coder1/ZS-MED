While it\u2019s not the only way to have some fun together, you might be wondering how on earth does a dog learn how to fetch? You might assume some dogs do it because of instinct, like retrievers. It\u2019s pretty much in their name that they should be you know, retrieving things!", "Fetch is a command almost every dog is able to learn. You can teach your dog to fetch anything from a tennis ball or rope toy to even the newspaper or a cold beverage for you. This can turn fetch from a fun game into a really cool party trick you and your dog can show off together. Whether it\u2019s just their toys in the yard or a show-stopping fetch me a drink at a party. You can use fetch as a great way to bond with your pup!", "", "When training any new skill you want your dog to be eager and ready to work. Keep training sessions short at first, even when the skill is fun. Even older dogs have a limited attention span so start with a 5-10 minute session depending on how long your dog is able to focus. You also want your pup to be hungry enough to want the treats you have. Your pup shouldn\u2019t be starving but training right after a big meal is not the ideal time. This is especially true if your training session is highly active. A full belly and too much running around can cause bloat, especially in breeds that are prone to it.", "You want your dog to connect with the object in any way. They may paw it, sniff it or put their mouth on it. Mark and reward every interaction. A marker can be a word, or a click if you clicker train that lets your dog know that what they did was right. It\u2019s hard to give a treat at the precise right moment so the marker lets your dog know the reward is on the way. This will allow your dog to understand the importance of this object.", "This might get your dog even more excited about the object, which is a good thing. Eventually, you\u2019ll want to have your dog take the object in their mouth. Mark and reward this behavior. Your dog will have to take the object out of their mouth to enjoy the tasty treat.", "Once you\u2019ve got your dog putting the object in their mouth reliably, you can move the object a few feet away and see if they\u2019ll bring it to you for another treat. It might take a few tries for them to figure this out. You should not even be saying the word fetch yet. Once your dog figures this out and brings you the toy a few times, that is when you add the word fetch.", "In step 4, the object was maybe only 1-2 feet away from you, but once your dog is consistently handing you that object you can increase your distance. Start with 3-4 feet and then gradually increase. See how far you can throw the object and have your pup bring it back. If you need a little help in this department, try a Chuckit!.", "", "Now that you\u2019ve got fetch down with this object, you might have to start over with each new object. This is because dogs don\u2019t generalize well. As you practice you can keep increasing distance and difficulty. You can try different household objects as long as your pup can safely carry them without getting hurt or damaging their teeth!", "", "The most important thing is to figure out why your dog doesn\u2019t want to fetch. If it is because your dog doesn\u2019t like to carry things in their mouth you want to rule out any underlying pain. Some dogs don\u2019t like things in their mouth because it hurts their teeth. If this is true for your dog, a dental exam at the vet might be in order. If they\u2019re older and getting winded after just one or two fetches, that\u2019s okay too you can just limit fetch or have them work on another trick that feels more fun and takes less energy.", "If your dog is losing interest in learning to fetch because they don\u2019t understand it, try breaking the steps down even more or consulting a trainer.", "Some dogs just aren\u2019t interested in fetching at all. They might prefer to run, chase or even just sleep!", "If your pup really hates to fetch for whatever reason there are plenty of other ways to have fun and tricks to learn. You and your pup can play hide and seek, run around together, go for a hike or even build up some new skills. If your pup doesn\u2019t want to fetch because they\u2019re not overly athletic consider something more low key like scent work or even training to become a therapy dog team!", "The Ollie blog is devoted to helping pet parents lead healthier lives with their pups.

As your dog gets better at this, you can gradually increase the time that you play fetch.", "No fetch inside. This rule is really, really important for your sanity \u2013 and your floors! Keeping tennis balls locked up will help immensely, but you probably still want to leave out some other toys. If your dog starts giving you squeaky toys or tug toys for fetch, just ignore him. Eventually, he will give up and go do something else.", "Only fetch when human initiates. This rule is ultra-important for teaching your dog how to entertain himself in other ways.

Be sure to calmly ignore pleads for fetch along the way!", "Barley still spends the first 20 minutes of most of our hikes placing sticks at my feet before he decides to give up and enjoy the hike. This lower-key energy release gives him time to sniff and leaves him in a much more all-around tired state when we\u2019re done.", "Teaching your dog other ways to have fun is important to a well-rounded dog.

My main issue is when I go to the dog park; when I want her to play with other dogs, she\u2019ll find a ball and drop it perfectly in between the feet of other people, as I taught her to do with me. People find this so cute, they ignore me when I ask them to not throw the ball, and start playing fetch with her. I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end of what to do, because if a dog wants to play with her while she is playing fetch, she will get annoyed at the intrusion and usually gently warn the other dog off. Little puppies rarely get the message though, and recently she snapped at a puppy who just didn\u2019t know to quit. She isn\u2019t resource guarding as she never fights if a dog steals the ball, she just doesn\u2019t like getting interrupted; I call it her work ethic. I suppose what I can do is try training her to ignore other balls at the dog park, but that won\u2019t help if people throw balls anyway. She\u2019s a German Shepherd/Australian Cattle Dog mix, so I think being a working dog makes it all the more serious to her.", "I do have a command, \u201cbring it here\u201d with which she\u2019ll give me the ball even if someone else threw it, after which I can get rid of the ball.

Those puppies would then pass their inherited skills down through their family tree.", "While it\u2019s unlikely that your family sends your Lab out hunting for food like we did in the past, your pup will still have inherited some of the retrieving skills passed down by their ancestors. And, of course, chasing and retrieving are two of the components of a successful game of fetch!", "Thanks to this inbuilt disposition for chasing and retrieving, many dogs are likely to get hooked quickly when they\u2019re first introduced to fetch as it\u2019s something that they\u2019re already naturally good at.", "So, when you play fetch with your dog and you notice how much they\u2019re enjoying themselves, that\u2019s because they\u2019re able to show off their ingrained capabilities.

Enjoying extended playtime with their owner as they get to chase after Frisbees and sticks really is a dream come true for many dogs.", "Unlike games of tug-of-war or even training, fetch requires less energy from you, the human, so you can playfully engage with your Lab for as long as you like and until they get tired.

the park or the backyard and playing a good old fashioned game of fetch.\u00a0 When attempting to play fetch with a dog, people often make the same mistakes going outside and\u00a0throwing the ball as far as they can and expecting their dog to get the ball and bring it back.\u00a0 The problem is, all dogs don\u2019t naturally retrieve or know the rules of the game that you are attempting to play

does not cover forced retrieves, blind or multiple retrieves, but simply shares information on how to start a young pup or even an older dog on bringing toys back to you.", "The first step to teaching a dog to fetch is finding a toy that interests them.\u00a0 Pay attention to what your dog likes to pick up or\u00a0carry around naturally.\u00a0 It may be a stuffed toy, a ball, a rope toy, a toy with a squeaker, or even a random item from around the house, such as a sock.\u00a0 Whatever the case may be, build some excitement with the toy and raise the dog\u2019s interest level.", "Start by placing your dog in a\u00a0environment that is lacking distractions so he can\u00a0be successful.\u00a0 We usually like to start fetch in a hallway with all of the doors closed so the dog has no other distractions;\u00a0you and the toy are now the most exciting things.\u00a0 Start peeking his interest in the toy by teasing him and making it look like fun.\u00a0 Keep him leashed so that once he has the object you can guide him back to you and the game does not end up with you chasing the dog for the toy.\u00a0 Refrain from praise until he comes back; this is key as many people praise the dog when he is chasing and/or mouthing the ball and the game ends there.\u00a0 Make a big deal that he did a great job by coming back to you with the toy.\u00a0 It may be helpful to hav an identical tennis ball or sock and throwing the second object as soon as the dog releases the first.\u00a0 Remember, we are playing fetch, not tug-of-war.", "If you get 2 great successes stop there and you may want to save the object that most interests him for your next play session.\u00a0 By stopping the game before your dog loses interest, it will leave him wanting more.\u00a0 As he starts to catch on what the game is and\u00a0really doing well, you will no longer need the leash to guide him back to you.\u00a0 Change locations to a room with less boundaries, and then graduate to outside in the yard.\u00a0 You may need to take a step back and reattach the leash to guide him back to you, and\u00a0remember to keep the distance of your throws short.\u00a0 Once he does well, start increasing

While this behavior is innate in some breeds, almost any dog, including an older dog, can be taught to play fetch. Many dogs prefer to fetch only specific items (tennis balls, for example), but introducing fetch to puppies with a variety of items, including stuffed or rubber toys and Frisbees, opens up a world of spontaneous games.

Those skills include a strong prey drive, a sturdy body and good physical fitness, a 'soft mouth' (which allowed them to carry the game without damaging it), impressive sniffing ability, an interest in birds, and a desire to please their owner.", "As a result, the love many modern dogs have for the classic game of fetch is a matter of genetics.

Where young children are involved I think it is a good idea to have a behaviourist come and observe your dog,  and give you advice on managing and/or resolving the problem.

Avoid behaviourists that talk about hierarchy and dominance,  this is irrelevant.  Your dog is simply afraid that the children are going to take away something he values.  It can transform a dog\u2019s relationship with children if he learns to respond to them in exchange for rewards.

This approach, called the Linear Optical Trajectory, makes the frisbee appear to move in a linear path at a constant speed. McBeath had previously noticed this interception strategy in professional baseball players pursuing fly balls.[1]", "Tim Pennings,[2] a mathematics professor at Hope College, has found that dogs are somehow able to calculate the optimal path to a ball thrown in the water. While playing Fetch with his Welsh Corgi, he noticed that the dog ran along the beach for a certain distance before jumping into the water. Because the dog is faster on land, this technique minimizes the total retrieval time. He showed that the dog is able to calculate the optimal point to jump into the water with statistical significance, a problem Pennings must resort to calculus to solve.", "Perruchet and Gallego[3] have demonstrated a method for calculating this optimal path using calculus in a different way. They propose that the dog optimizes its behaviour on a moment-to-moment basis, choosing at each moment the path that allows it to maximize its speed of approach to the ball.  This requires the dog to be able to accurately estimate its speed on both land and water, but does not rely on the premise that the dog plans the entire route in advance.[4]"]], "https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/playing-fetch-in-the-garden-gm928427602-254655577": [{"h1": ["Playing Fetch in the Garden stock photo..."], "h2": ["UK, Front or Back Yard, Family, Dog, Playful", "Description", "Add licenses", "{{step.title}}Our base collection.

These are likely remnants of old genetic code, an ancestral drive handed down from generations past. You see, Labrador retrievers were not originally a bird hunting dog, a sport dog. Really, hunting for sport appeared relatively recently in human history. Sure, we have records of old world gentry and royalty using dogs and falcons to hunt for fun, but most people relied on hunting as a source of income or food until the last century or so, when some level of disposable income was incorporated into lifestyles, and conservation departments developed hunting licenses and seasons to fund conservation and manage populations. Subsistence hunting really began to change to more of a recreational pursuit with the benefit of providing food. Labrador retrievers have been playing a role in hunting as it developed both for food and for sport. Before that, though, if you look back before people decided to use a retrieving dog to fetch back ducks or doves, they were used to retrieve other items for work. Labradors were used by fishermen to retrieve ropes, floats, and even fish that fell out of nets or slipped off of barbless hooks.", "If you have spent a lot of time with a lab or two, this probably comes as no surprise. My first lab, a chocolate female, was a fetching machine\u2014on the clock. She didn\u2019t care to fetch just to kill time, but when it came to hunting, she would fetch like mad. Once, I shot a wood duck that landed on the water, and proceeded to dive as wounded ducks are apt to do. My lab followed suit, disappearing under water. The duck went under a floating leatherleaf bog, and she followed, disappearing out of sight. I panicked, jumped out of my skiff, and reached blindly under the bog until I felt a kicking leg and dragged her back to the surface coughing and gagging. She was ready to die to fetch that duck.", "The thing about her, though, is that she loved retrieving fish. She would bring dead fish from along shore. She would try to grab the fish out of our water garden or the aquarium. She would even pick up and carry around the frozen fish lying on the surface of the lake by where we were ice fishing.

When the dogs were asked to carry a toy that weighed about half a kilogram (1.1lbs) the dogs started to carry 66% of their weight on their front legs. When asked to carry a 4kg (8.8lbs) object, equivalent to carrying a bird or large branch, they started to place 75% of their weight on their front legs.", "The impact of this weight shift could result in strains and muscular injuries according to Dr Bockstahler:", "\"It is likely with the increasing speed during running or jumping, the forces acting on the joints and soft tissues will increase. In animals with existing joint, tendon or muscle disorders, this could have a negative effect. Also in young, growing animals, this could have a negative effect, especially if the weights they are carrying are heavy. Training should be performed carefully. It does not mean retrieving work is bad, but it must be performed with the knowledge that it puts stress on the limbs.\"", "In larger breeds, carrying a tennis ball should not cause a weight shift, but in smaller dogs, it could. Equally, dogs that regularly chase and carry heavy footballs (soccer balls) will weight shift and potentially place strain on their front legs.", "But it is not just carrying balls that could cause injuries. The action of charging out after a ball could place unnecessary strain on a dog's joints, leading to long-term problems such as arthritis. Veterinarian Hanna Capon is the founder of the Canine Arthritis Management website and has concerns about the damaging effects caused by ball chasing, especially when using ball throwers that launch the object a long way off:", "\"We need to realise we're asking dogs to run like athletes. They're going from standing still to a gallop, then throwing themselves in [the] air, braking and skidding. This might be up and down a hill or on a beach, and it's causing damage to their joints and trauma to muscles and cartilage. But because the dog is so excited, they carry on through the pain. For the many dogs who might have injuries or mobility problems, we're making these even worse, meaning pets need to be on medication. This can take years off their life expectancy.\"", "The real issue is the way that many dogs are encouraged to repetitively chase ball after ball, with the intention of tiring them out.

Every summer in the UK and US, dogs are rushed to their vets suffering from heatstroke. Sadly, some do not recover.", "One of the common triggers for heatstroke in dogs is ball chasing on a sunny day. The very act of running out fast for the ball raises the dog's body temperature, then they carry the ball in their mouths, preventing them from panting.

High arousal becomes the new norm. I\u2019m often called in to work with dogs who have trouble controlling themselves or calming down. These dogs are often reactive and hyper-vigilant.\"", "Many people believe ball games will help their dog burn energy and calm down, but in high-drive or obsessive dogs, the opposite can easily be true. They become more and more hyper as the game goes on, and have trouble calming down afterwards. If this happens every day, they end up never able to fully relax, especially if they are being walked three times a day and have balls thrown for them during each walk. The result is a restless, stressed dog that cannot settle, and owners respond by doing more ball throwing to try to tire them out, only to end up worsening the problem.", "Jumping and twisting for a frisbee can result in serious injuries", "Rick Bolin on Visual Hunt", "Some owners don't throw balls, they throw Frisbees. The advantage of a Frisbee is that it flies a long way in a straight line, and many dogs like to leap up and grab it. There is even a sport called Disc Dog or Frisbee Dog. Frisbee throwing can produce the same problems as mentioned above with ball throwing, but there are also additional issues associated with the game. One is known as 'Tongue Bite'\u2014this is when an excited dog who is panting hard bites down on a Frisbee and catches their tongue in the process.", "But the greatest concern with Frisbee throwing is when dogs leap to grab the disc. They often twist their bodies at acute angles and land on their hind feet first, rather than their front feet. This is not the way dogs are designed to jump, and their back legs are not as good at absorbing the impact of the leap as their front legs.", "In 2014, a pet show in Cumbria decided to remove a Frisbee throwing contest after concerns about the impact it could have on the dogs involved.

So, he surely keeps playing fetch.", "We can\u2019t deny the fact that playing fetch provides a great time for you and your dog. In order to play this game with your pet, you don\u2019t need much energy. This allows you to playfully engage with your pet as long as you want. This is actually an interactive game. It can be able to encourage the bond of your dog. You can choose to play this game with a long walk in the park. Also, you can combine it with a couple of additional training exercises.", "The fact is that some dogs love playing fetch than others. For example, the Labrador retriever is able to hunt down as well as retrieve things for their owners. Dogs that inevitably passed on these skills will be good at playing fetch.", "The first important thing you need to do is to determine if your dog has an inclination towards fetch at all. In order to do this, you have to dangle an object such as a toy, a ball, or a stick in front of his face. Do this for a few seconds. Then, toss the object away in a short distance from him. Then, see whether your dog tries to chase the object you throw. If he does, it\u2019s a good sign. You should consider training your pet to chase over longer distances. If possible, do this in different locations. If you see your dog doesn\u2019t like to chase the object, it\u2019s time to spend a long time making your dog interested in the object before tossing it.", "If your dog still is not interested in the object, you should try different toys such as tennis balls, Frisbees, or stuffed chew toys. It\u2019s a good idea to praise and reward your dog when he brings the object back to you. Make sure to stop the game before your dog gets tired. The most important thing when training your dog to fetch is the consistency. After your training, your dog should feel excited to play with it. It means your dog has to understand the point of fetch first.", "Don\u2019t worry if your dog isn\u2019t interested in a game of fetch. He cannot chase the object you\u2019ve tossed away. On the other hands, some dogs are interested in chasing but not retrieving. There may be some problems that can prevent your dog from participating in the game of fetch. Another problem is the jaw problem. It can make your dog hurt to pick up the object in his mouth. Besides, dogs with any leg injuries also don\u2019t like to chase something. Thus, it\u2019s important to determine the reason why your dog doesn\u2019t fetch.", "In order to handle this problem, we recommend you to have at least 2 different toys on the go. Sometimes, you may have to exchange them. Not at all your dog can understand why you\u2019re tossing the object. In this situation, it\u2019s best to start small. Try getting a specific thing for the game of fetch. Make sure you choose something your dog likes for the game of fetch.", "Thomas Leavy", "my name is\u00a0Thomas Leavy.
