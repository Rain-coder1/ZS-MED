Follow the steps below to come up with a budget that works for you.", "Since most people can't afford to pay for a whole-home renovation in cash, the first step toward budgeting for a home remodel is to consider your financing options. There are a few different ways that homeowners may choose to cover these costs.", "We'll get into more specifics about the various renovation loan options that are available to you below, but the important thing to note right now is that getting your financing in order first will give you a firm idea of how much you have to spend.", "Once your financing is in place, the next step is to get clear on how you want the finished remodel to look.

However, keep in mind that since those outlines take a fair amount of time to put together, you may be charged for the service.", "Remodeling projects often end up costing more than their initial estimates because of unexpected road bumps that occur along the way. With that in mind, when putting your budget together, you may want to pad the estimates that you receive in order to account for unanticipated expenses. It's generally a good idea to add an additional 10% to 20% to the budget for those costs.", "As mentioned above, there are many options for covering the remodel costs of a complete home renovation. We've listed the most common ones below for your consideration:", "If you're just moving into the home you plan to remodel, consider using an FHA 203k home improvement loan. A 203k loan allows you to wrap the cost of repairs up in your mortgage, meaning you only have to worry about making one loan payment.

However, they are also highly regulated, and there are specifications for how money must be spent.", "A cash-out refinance involves refinancing your existing home loan and taking out more money than you currently owe on your home. The excess money from the loan is given to you in cash and can be put toward anything you'd like, including your new kitchen renovation or bathroom remodel.", "Refinancing your loan also typically offers better interest rates than other financing options. However, it comes with a big caveat.

In this case, you'll be able to borrow money against the equity in your home, as needed, up to a limit predetermined by your lender.", "That flexibility is what makes HELOCs a particularly good option as a renovation loan. However, like the 203k loan and cash-out refinancing, it also comes with a potential foreclosure risk if you stop making your monthly payments.", "In contrast, personal loans are unsecured, which means they're not tied to an asset like your home. Instead, your approval for the loan is based on personal factors like your debt-to-income ratio and credit score. That said, a personal loan will typically have the highest interest rates out of all the options on this list.", "Materials are usually the most variable expense in a whole home remodel. Using all high-end materials can add thousands of dollars to your final costs. If you're trying to stick to a budget while renovating, your best bet is to choose where to splurge and where to save. As a rule of thumb, it's best to invest the most money in each room's focal point features, like high-end appliances, and to choose midrange items everywhere else.", "Bear in mind that high-priced items are often priced by the square foot, so you'll also want to keep the size of the room in mind when you're creating your budget. Generally, the more square footage there is, the more you can expect the material to cost.", "Put simply, the cost of moving plumbing and electrical features can add up fast. You can save money on a kitchen renovation, for example, if you leave the appliances where they are and keep the layout as is. In this case, you can spend your money simply adding semi-custom cabinets, fresh fixtures, or new countertops instead.", "Remodeling an entire house is obviously going to be a costly undertaking.

Even if you like the house a lot, it is necessary to make an appraisal to determine the cost of the renovating, this budget should be delimited before you make the purchase.

Make sure you\u2019ll be permitted to build, or, if it is your intention, to increase the house size or build a swimming pool, etc.", "Don\u2019t end up with a piece of rural land where you can do nothing but plant vegetables! Most places can be checked fairly easily through a contact in the local town council or checking out the official documents (valid building licenses or official plans/maps that prove the location is in a buildable area).", "Occasionally previous owners have already developed projects that have been approved by local authorities, in which case you should verify that they are valid and official. Approved projects are usually valid for a year (although the period can be prolonged).", "If you decide to build/renovate yourself, you will have to obtain the relevant council permit.", "Small interior works and certain outside works that don\u2019t change the exterior shape and look of a structure don\u2019t require a paid license, but you will always need a declaration of legality from the authorities.", "For other major works, you should hire an architect to develop a project to present to local authorities. To choose this crucial partner in the whole process you should rely on other people\u2019s experiences and, of course, on your own impressions! Visit other completed projects to see what and who suits you best. During this phase, make sure that the project you are developing accurately represents what you want. This prevents making alterations in future works, which can lead to costs spinning out of control.", "Typically, the architectural project is approved first, but to obtain a building license, be aware that you must order several other technical and engineering projects (structural, electrical, hydraulics, communications, etc.) which also need to be approved by local authorities and independent organizations.", "This process can be somewhat complicated and (in most cases) slow, depending on a variety of factors: the complexity of the project, the number of local authorities involved, etc. In some councils, the details required can be incredible and the whole process can become very difficult at one point or another for everybody involved. Don\u2019t lose hope\u2013this is not abnormal.", "It is difficult to give an estimate of the total time needed because it depends on which council is responsible for where you are developing your house (and on a thousand other things), but be prepared to wait for several months, even though the process can also be surprisingly quick sometimes!", "Make sure that your architect keeps you informed of all the steps involved in the process. After approval, you must pay a variable amount for the building license, which in some councils is still very low.", "In the meantime, you can start contacting construction firms to get a total budget for the works in question. You can also decide to order separate quotes for individual parts of the project (which can lower costs), but in this case, you must absolutely know someone whom you trust completely to assist you.", "Always get at least three budgets (again from recommended and trusted firms whose previous projects you\u2019ve seen), and make sure that all aspects of the construction are included and previewed\u2013technical aspects and building methods as well as materials and finishes. Don\u2019t always go for the cheapest quote, because this choice can turn out to be the most expensive in the long run. Choose the firm that gives you the most confidence through previous works and information from friends.", "During construction try to be present as much as you can, because this will help you to control all aspects of the process much better.", "Payments should be agreed on beforehand, and although a first payment is usually at the beginning of construction, don\u2019t make any more payments after that until the work is done. Be very careful with extra works\u2013sometimes construction firms rely on that to make some profit after giving cheap estimates!", "After construction, all is not quite yet over! You must obtain the necessary water, electricity, communications and gas supplies and also pay for the respective connections.", "Finally, don\u2019t forget that you have to register your new house and, of course, pay the respective tax!", "Despite the long list of things to think about, don\u2019t be alarmed!\u00a0 These are just general warnings that should be taken into account no matter where you are.

With options for tile, stone, glass, ceramic, and beaded board, there are so many opportunities to find a material that\u2019s right for your budget. Another frugal option is to only install a backsplash where it provides the most protection, like behind a range or near a sink.", "Stand-alone tables or cabinets can be a cost-friendly feature for an island-less kitchen.

To save a little extra money, aim to reuse the existing curtain rods and rings.", "If your home has scarce overhead lighting, you might be having a hard time getting the right balance of light. This is even more true in older homes with fewer outlets available for floor and side lamps. In these instances, installing a dimmer switch can be your quick and easy solution: keep it bright when accomplishing tasks, but turn it down for softer ambient lighting that\u2019s comfortable for lounging.", "You can add both style and storage to your bathroom with a simple, budget-smart change: a new medicine cabinet.

You can even get the illusion of wainscoting by applying trim or lumber to an area of the wall as an outline, then use paint to tie the wall and trim together to imitate the real deal. It looks high-end without all the cost. Choose prefinished millwork to cut down on labor time, or finish it yourself to save even more on your renovation budget.", "A guaranteed way to update your bedroom is to add a headboard, whether it's small and stately or oversize and dramatic. To buy new, they can get quite expensive, but there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for maximizing your style and budget with DIY headboards.", "Kids bedrooms present an ever-evolving home renovation conundrum: They quickly move from toys and books to collectibles and beyond, and finding where to store all of that stuff can be difficult. A simple home renovation change that's easy on the budget is to add narrow, wall-to-wall shelves. They're inexpensive and don't require a huge footprint to fit in a variety of bedroom sizes.", "Dining rooms are often stuck in a light fixture time warp. But a few hundred dollars and a little bit of electrical DIY can give your ceiling space (and your room) a game-changing focal point.

But those are great spots to add pops of color with paint or wallpaper. Another idea: Swap out the door inserts for glass or apply colored film to existing glass. These little touches can go a long way to making a room feel renewed.", "A seat, a shelf, and some hooks are really all you need to create a life-changing, budget-smart mudroom, even in a tiny space. You can buy expensive organizers designed for this function, or you can combine reused and repurposed pieces with less expensive newer items that work together as a whole solution. If you have the space for it, a cubby for each family member makes the daily routine easier.", "A creative use of paint is a budget-friendly way to renovate the path from one floor to another.
