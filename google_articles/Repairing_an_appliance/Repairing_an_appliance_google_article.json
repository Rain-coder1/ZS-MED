A good rule of thumb when it comes to replacing versus fixing your broken appliance is this: The closer your appliance is to its hypothetical past due date, the wiser it is to replace the appliance rather than repair it. Depending on the quality and initial price of your appliances, most kitchen appliances like ovens, stove ranges and refrigerators tend to last between 7-15 or so years.", "Also, consider the 50 percent rule. If an appliance is more than 50 percent through its lifespan, and if the cost of one repair is more than 50 percent of the cost of buying a brand-spanking-new appliance, then it might be worth replacing it rather than repairing it.", "Investing in a new water-saving and energy-efficient appliance may be worth it down the road. A modern brand-new refrigerator, for example, uses roughly half of the electricity of a comparable fridge built 20+ years ago. On the other hand, replacing energy-sucking kitchen appliances that still have \u2018miles\u2019 left on them may not be the smartest penny-pinching move. You actually might end up spending thousands on an appliance in order to save hundreds of dollars, if you\u2019re lucky, on your energy bill.", "If you\u2019re seriously looking into this broken appliance matter, we urge you to consider our entertaining thoughts on the matter. For further authority on broken appliance troubleshooting, check out what Jill A. Notini\u2019s thoughts are.", "Jill works with the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, so her thoughts are probably worth taking note. She says that if you\u2019re planning on staying in your home for 10 to 15 years, then upgrading appliances is most likely a worthy investment. However, if you\u2019re planning on moving sometime soon, then you\u2019ll save money by keeping your older appliances and letting the new owners of the home upgrade to more energy-efficient kitchen appliance models.", "The hidden and extra cost associated with replacing an appliance may actually include more than just the original price of the new machine itself. Under the right (or wrong) conditions, the price tag of the new household appliance could be the least of the money that you\u2019ll end up spending on an upgrade. How can this be?", "Well, if you get a new refrigerator that\u2019s a different size than your old one, it may not fit in the spot that your old fridge was in. In this case, you may have to modify the cabinetry in order to properly fit the new appliance, which could require professional carpentry services to ensure that the job is done accurately and properly. \u00a0Also, upgrading from a simple gas stovetop to one with many bells and whistles may mean that you\u2019ll have to upgrade or add various electrical wiring and circuits, and that\u2019s probably no fun for you or your wallet.", "If your broken kitchen appliance is new enough to where repairs or an outright replacement is still covered under its manufacturer warranty, then you\u2019ll obviously want to take advantage of that. Not sure if you\u2019re still covered under warranty or not? Simply check your owner\u2019s manual or records to see if your broken appliance is still under warranty. Most warranties on major appliances cover labor and parts for a year, and some extend coverage of certain parts for two years.
