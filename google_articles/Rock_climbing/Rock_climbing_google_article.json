Now, it\u2019s a common occurrence to see climbers show off their skills on social media, making you feel both impressed at their photos and particularly subconscious about your skinny arms.", "Although looking at videos of Aquaman\u2019s Jason Momoa climbing walls like a beast and being amazed at pictures of climbers holding on to tiny rocks over vertiginous heights might make you think otherwise, rock climbing is one of the most welcoming and exciting sports in existence today. Here are the main reasons why you should consider giving it a try.", "When it comes to climbing, age and size are not limiting factors. It\u00a0doesn\u2019t matter how tall, big, or old you are, your body will be able to adapt, and it\u2019ll find its way to the top of the wall you decide to climb. It\u2019s unlike most other sports that require an early start or a specific advantage to make great achievements. All you need is to learn the basic movements, and you\u2019re set. So despite what you see when you Google \u201crock climbing,\u201d this sport does not involve a battle of the fittest.

In your early stages you\u2019ll be feeling pain in muscles you didn\u2019t even know existed! The most satisfying aspect is that while your body works hard to fight gravity, your brain gets so fully pumped with dopamine and serotonin that it doesn\u2019t process the workout as a punishment like it does when you do burpees.", "In time, your endurance will improve, you\u2019ll become more flexible, and your strength will multiply.

Nowadays, climbing gyms are opening up even in small towns so the likelihood that you\u2019re just a couple of hours away from one is very high. It\u2019s a fun activity that can keep you or the whole family entertained for a good part of your day, no matter the time of day, no matter the season.", "Research has found that sports involving an element of fear cause the brain to release higher doses of endorphins, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters alleviate pain and enhance performance, making the body feel a whole new level of excitement. Thus the scarier the sport is, the more addictive it can be. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy to get hooked on rock climbing despite a fear of heights.", "TThere is nothing like the view from the summit of a rock you\u2019ve just climbed.", "Once you start climbing outdoors, your perspective on traveling will change.

Forget about the beach; let\u2019s climb that epic cliff and enjoy the sunset from high above!", "Problem-solving is a central aspect of climbing. Every route is like a puzzle you need to solve. In fact, routes are called \u2018problems\u2019 in the bouldering arena. You have to get inventive, be consistent, and be persistent if you want to complete a new challenge because it doesn\u2019t matter if you get beta from other climbers or if you can\u2019t reach a specific hold\u2014you are the one that has to climb to the top.", "It\u2019s a sport that requires a lot of brain power. You have to stay focused and convince your body that it can do the climb even when your muscles want to give up. It\u2019s also a great way to get more teamwork experience, building relationships and establishing roles to carry out an activity in the most efficient way possible.", "Rock climbing trains your body as much as it trains your brain. It entails hard-work, but the rewards will keep you coming back.

Indoors, you\u2019ll have plenty of support from setters and fellow climbers, as well as a more clear-cut path in front of you (as in, holds with colors telling you where best to place your hands and feet).", "Most indoor gyms are either strictly for bouldering\u2014climbing relatively short heights, with no ropes and a thick mat (called a crash pad) below you to catch your fall\u2014or for bouldering and top-roping, in which you wear a harness attached to a rope and belay system, climb to the top, then repel down with the help of a climbing partner (the belayer) on the ground.", "\u201cBouldering is the easiest way to get into climbing and only requires shoes and some chalk,\u201d says Emma Twyford, a professional climber and route setter based in the U.K. Bouldering also may be more appealing for new climbers trying to conquer a fear of heights. \u201cThe first time I climbed, I only climbed side to side.

If you find yourself becoming a regular in the gym, though, or are ready to head outdoors, you\u2019ll want to invest in your own pair of shoes. It sounds obvious, but the main goal is to find a shoe that fits your foot well. You want something relatively flat to start; a more aggressive shoe, with a curved toe, won\u2019t do you much good off the bat, Monnett says, as you won\u2019t be using your toes much yet when climbing. Head to an REI or other local sports retailer to try on a few pairs from popular brands like La Sportiva, So iLL, and Butora.", "Crash pads are expensive, the climbers we talk to note, so until you\u2019re really serious about climbing regularly outside the gym, you\u2019re better off climbing with more experienced (and geared up) friends first, taking courses with instructors who can provide gear, or renting a mat at a climbing site. For bouldering, you\u2019ll want to have chalk and a chalk bag on hand; you can find basic ones at most sports retailers, but if you want something more custom, Etsy has plenty of options.", "For those top-roping, the gear list is more extensive: You\u2019ll need a 60 to 70m rope, a couple of carabiners, a sturdy harness (make sure it is UIAA certified), a helmet, a ground cloth or tarp for your rope to dangle on, and a belay assisted braking device like a Petzl Grigri, plus shoes and chalk. Depending on where and when you\u2019re climbing, \u201cPlenty of good warm clothing is important,\u201d Twyford says. \u201cI love to climb in leggings but I tend to have to wear a sports top, a Capilene base layer, R2 tech hoodie, and then an assortment of Patagonia down jackets.\u201d [Editor's note: Patagonia is one of Twyford's sponsors.]", "If you\u2019re really into the nitty gritty of climbing, the Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills mountain guide comes highly recommended as a sort of compendium of best practices, with sections on how to perform basic first aid, how to snow climb, and more.", "Climbers in Stone Fort during the 2017 Flash Foxy Women\u2019s Climbing Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee.", "To find places to climb in your area, or in an area you may soon be road tripping to, mountainproject.com, the Crag, and 8a.nu are great resources for routes.

If you don\u2019t have friends already well-versed in climbing, groups like Brown Girls Climb, Never Stop Moving, and Flash Foxy exist to help women tap into the community and meet people to climb with.

Lee, Ph.D.\u00a0\u00a0From  University of Massachusetts Boston", "Bouldering - indoor rock climbing - is growing in popularity and it is also being used as a treatment for depression in group therapy.", "While rock climbing has been around for decades, the number of people climbing has steadily increased in the last 10 years as the number of climbing gyms has increased about 10 percent in the United States alone.1 It is estimated that in the U.S, 1,000 to 1,500 new people try climbing each day.2 So what is it about this sport that's got so many people hooked?", "Rock climbing is a physical sport, but many consider it a mental one as well. After all, it depends on your faith in yourself and your abilities, and your abilities to manage fear and anxiety and solve problems in the moment, trust in your climbing partners, an awareness and acceptance of current limits, and the facility to mindfully focus on your movements. In short, rock climbing requires some of the core psychotherapeutic mechanisms of change, such as trust in yourself and others, cognitive flexibility, self-efficacy (which is the belief in one's ability to do or cope with something successfully), emotional awareness, acceptance, and mindfulness.", "Studies indicate that rock climbing is associated with decreased depression and anxiety3, increased self-efficacy4, and greater levels of mindfulness5. These qualities have led some psychiatric hospitals in Germany to use indoor rock climbing as a psychotherapeutic intervention for depression and anxiety.6", "There is plenty of anecdotal evidence about the benefits of using rock climbing as a psychotherapeutic intervention, but only a few studies have explicitly examined it as a clinical intervention, most of which have been case studies.7 To address this, researchers at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00c3\u00bcrnberg in Germany conducted a controlled experiment to examine the effectiveness of an indoor bouldering (a type of rock climbing) group therapy as a treatment for depression.6", "In their study, a total of 47 individuals with clinically significant depression met for three hours eight times weekly, in groups no larger than 15. Each of the sessions had a theme (mindfulness, changing old habits, self-efficacy, fear, and trust) and were led by two therapists, both of whom were climbers.", "The sessions started with a mindfulness exercise, followed by psychoeducation about the session's theme, bouldering games or exercises relevant to the session theme (for example, climbing blind-folded), and time to work on personal bouldering projects with support from a therapist. Each session ended with another mindfulness meditation, followed by a discussion of the skills learned and how group members could use the skills outside of the session. Additionally, group members were encouraged to support and help each other.", "The results of the study indicated that, compared to a control group (a list of individuals waiting to receive the therapy), those in the bouldering therapy group experienced a decrease in depression, as well as an increase in self-efficacy and coping ability.", "The results seem to indicate that bouldering therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, but several things must be considered. First, the researchers did not formally assess for depression; participants reported clinically significant levels of depression, but they were not formally diagnosed. Further research will have to establish bouldering therapy as an effective treatment for a depressive disorder. On average, the participants scored in the moderate range when they self-reported their depression. So while bouldering therapy may be effective in those with moderate depression, research will be necessary to reach conclusions about its effectiveness on those with severe levels of depression.", "The study focused just on indoor bouldering, which is only one type of climbing. Although other case studies have shown that other types of climbing are associated with greater mindfulness and decreased anxiety,7 it is unclear if other types of climbing can also be used as a treatment for depression. Further research could examine the effect of using other types of indoor (e.g., top rope or lead climbing) or outdoor (bouldering, sport, ice, aid, or trad) climbing, most of which are associated with greater risk, require a climbing partner, as well as a large amount of trust in those partners.", "Finally, it is unclear which part of the therapy is driving the change. Is it specifically bouldering? The increased self-efficacy? The mindfulness training? The sense of community and social support that the participants received from other group members? Or perhaps it's the physical activity, which has been repeatedly shown to decrease depression.8 Likely, it's a mix of all, which, except for the first, can be found in other social or partnered sports.", "Indeed, a recent study found that rock climbing and other forms of physical fitness lead to comparable decreases in both depression and anxiety.3 Further studies are necessary to examine bouldering therapy specifically in relation to other types of therapy, but these results point out the benefits of using rock climbing and other physical activities to decrease depression.", "4339", "1.

The climbing techniques and specific moves often differ when one is doing rock climbing vs. bouldering. Additionally, different levels of strength and endurance are required for each one. If you are planning to supplement your climbing with home workouts and routines that consist of stretches/ yoga and hangboards, then the more these training plans should be specifically tailored for rock climbers or boulderers.", "We will cover a few of the following factors in this article, but note the terminology and difficulty grading differs between rock climbing and bouldering. In addition, significantly different climbing gear is required ( rock climbing being more expensive).", "But the most significant difference between rock climbing and bouldering is the way that they are executed and protected. Rock climbing is done with a rope and protective gear, while bouldering only requires the use of a crashpad. Lets explore more.", "Due to the differences in hold and foothold type, the style and technique required to be a good rock climber is different than that which is required to be a good boulderer. High wall climbing routes are longer and more sustained, and it takes someone with mental strength, endurance and a great memory to be able to remember all of the sequences on a full highwall climbing route.", "Bouldering also requires problem solving. But because boulder problems are usually quite short, it\u2019s easier to remember the sequences. However, small hand and footholds require boulderers to have the right body positioning in order to stay on the rock or hold.", "Perhaps the easiest analogy to understand the difference between rock climbing and bouldering is long distance running vs. sprints. While a marathon runner relies more on endurance, sprinters use more strength and raw power. The same goes for rock climbers vs. boulderers.", "High wall indoor and outdoor rock climbers climb routes that range between 8 and 40 meters, so they often rely on their endurance to get them all the way to the top. On the other hand, boulders are rarely taller than 4 or 5 meters, meaning that the difficult moves are more concentrated. Harder moves for boulderers means that more strength is required.", "However, it\u2019s important to understand that endurance is also important for boulderers as strength is for rock climbers. Long rock climbing routes often have a difficult crux move, which certainly requires strength. Additionally, long boulder problems that requires endurance, such as traverses, are quite common.", "When it comes to the types of muscles used, a high wall rock climber climbing attempting a route that is a relatively easy grade for them will be using slow-twitch muscles. On the other hand, explosive moves and body tension often required when bouldering. as it requires the use of fast-twitch muscles.", "Because they demand the use of slightly different muscle groups and skills, rock climbing and bouldering training tend to differ. Though rock climbers must also train strength and bouldering skills, they complement it with plenty of endurance training, such as repeating routes with little or shorter rest time in between.", "Boulderers on the other hand, are more focused on training max-strength by trying difficult boulder problems and hangboard-ing. They also more frequently training moves that are very common in bouldering, such as toe hooks, heel hooks, mantles, dynos, and sit starts. Though some of these moves are also found in rock climbing, they are much lest frequently used in rock climbing than in bouldering.", "All things considered, rock climbing and bouldering training have more similarities than differences. Both are active activities that require using almost the entire musculature of the body, meaning that both require full-body training plans.", "Aside from training their finger and upper-body strength, both rock climbers and boulderers must also train core strength, leg strength, body tension, and balance.", "Aside from differences when it comes to physical demands and training regiments, rock climbing also differs from bouldering when it comes to terminology.", "Read on to find a list of common rock climbing/bouldering-specific terms with definitions.", "Additionally, rock climbing routes and boulder problem are each graded using a different scale. When it comes to rock climbing grades, each region uses a unique grading system. The most common system is the French system, with routes ranging between the grades of 2 (easiest) and 9c. In the United States, the Yosemite system is used, with routes ranging from 5.0-5.15, while the Australian system is based on numbers ranging from 3 to 39.", "Bouldering also uses the French system, with boulder problems ranging from 4 to 8c+. However, when using the French system, the same rock climbing grade number in rock climbing does not match the difficulty as that grade number in bouldering. For example, a 7a boulder problem is more physically demanding than a 7a climbing route.", "Another commonly used system in bouldering is the V-system, which starts at V0 and goes all the way up to V17, an extremely difficult grade that very few have climbed.", "Given that rock climbing and bouldering are performed in such different manners, it\u2019s no surprise that they require different climbing gear needs. Rock climbers need significantly more climbing gear than boulderers.", "Aside from the chalk and climbing shoes that any form/ type of climbing requires, rock climbing calls for a harness, a rope, quickdraws, a personal anchor system, a belay device ( made up of an ATC and Carabiner) and lastly, a helmet. On the other hand, all you need to boulder is a crashpad and some trustworthy friends to spot you.", "Lastly, when it comes to attire and clothing for climbing, boulderers and climbers both see the value of comfortable climbing tops and climbing pants that are breathable and stretchable to maximise climbing performance. The last thing you want is a pair of pants that is stiff and difficult for you to do a full sit in move.", "Climbing all day can be a tiring process. Consider getting a few extra accessories as gifts for climbing friends. Some best affordable ideas are portable chairs or hammocks to make the climbing trip more comfortable.", "Rock climbing and bouldering both pose distinct challengers for beginners. One the one hand, rock climbing is a mentally difficult sport to begin. It can be a great challenge for those who suffer from fear of heights. Also, there are a lot of safety measures that must be learned and memorised.", "On the other hand, bouldering requires much more raw strength than rock climbing. This means it can be more physically demanding for new climbers who have not yet developed climbing-specific muscles. In summary, rock climbing is harder for beginners who struggle with fear of heights, while bouldering is more of a challenge for beginners who lack finger and upper-body strength.", "Though both forms of sport poses risk, both rock climbing and bouldering can be safe activities when correctly executed. Both present the possibility of overuse injuries, such as finger tendon/ pulley strains and shoulder injuries, and both present the possibility of accident-incurred injuries.", "When it comes to rock climbing, injuries are few and far between. Most are a result of muscle or tendon strains, such as the ones listed above, though you can get a bit banged up if you have an unpleasant fall. The most common injuries incurred when rock climbing are simple bumps, surface level skin tears and bruises. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that it is always possible to experience an extremely dangerous ground fall if the proper safety measures aren\u2019t taken.", "Bouldering can be a bit riskier. Because you are climbing without a rope at quite a height, you will always fall and land on the ground, which increases your risk of sprained ankles, broken feet, and knee injuries.", "However, these injuries can be avoided with good spotters and proper crashpad placement. Additionally, due to the fact that individual moves in bouldering are more difficult and often use smaller holds than in rock climbing, finger tendon and pulley injuries tend to be more common in boulderers than in rock climbers.", "In the end, whether rock climbing or bouldering is better for you depends on personal preferences! Just like some people prefer a marathon and others a sprint, rock climbing and bouldering present distinct physical demands and also offer distinct rewards.", "If you love the thrill of heights and beautiful scenery, you\u2019d make a great outdoor rock climber, and if you love short bursts and technical challenges to push your body to its physical limit, bouldering is the best option for you!

All these helps when you transit to do high wall rock climbing, where you can focus on other aspects like endurance.", "If you climb and boulder consistently 2-3 times a week at least, you would see that your technical skills start to improve quite consistently in 6-9 weeks. However, it usually gets harder to move up the grade when you are at V4 or V5, getting to V6 or V7. So you would need to increase your frequency as well as add on some home training to retain the muscle memory.", "This is a million dollar question that many questions ask. In simple terms, trad climbing is the purest and most traditional form of climbing where you leave the climbing place as untouched as possible.

The one thing I assumed I could figure out was how to put on my harness\u2014after all, you step into it like a pair of pants\u2014but it turned out I was wearing it backward, which I didn\u2019t realize until a different instructor noticed and gently pointed out my error. Any excitement I felt about trying a new sport was completely overshadowed by the fact that I was clearly and totally unprepared for a situation that seemed very risky.", "Fast forward about two years, and I go to the climbing gym about once a week. I no longer spend five minutes sweating and quadruple-checking that my harness is tight enough. But if you\u2019re thinking of trying indoor climbing, know that it\u2019s very natural to be intimidated at first. Any experienced climber has been there too.", "Below, you\u2019ll find a ton of info about what you\u2019ll probably see and hear in the gym your first time, which will (hopefully) make it a bit easier to get outside your comfort zone and up the wall. And yes, your forearms and hands are going to be sore in places you didn\u2019t even know existed. It happens.", "There are really just two important things to keep in mind before your first climb, and they\u2019re both super practical. One: Wear comfortable clothes you can really move in. You\u2019re going to be stretching your limbs every which way, which is a thing you can\u2019t really do in jeans. Two: Make sure your nails are trimmed. You don\u2019t need to have super short nails to climb, but I\u2019ve found that, as someone who has longer nails, keeping them trimmed down makes it easier to grip with my fingertips and also helps me not worry that I\u2019m going to tear off a whole nail accidentally. Also, climbing is a great way to ruin a manicure, so don\u2019t go right after you\u2019ve had one.", "The climbing gyms I\u2019ve been to have always been pretty casual, and anyone who climbs will tell you how supportive and laid-back climbers are; it\u2019s a community that\u2019s known for being chill and welcoming\u2014even though it can feel like you\u2019re walking into a locals bar where everyone knows each other but you the first time you go. \u201cEveryone\u2019s here to have a good time, and no one\u2019s looking down on anyone else.

You may then choose to do an intro session with a staff member, where they\u2019ll belay you\u2014control/anchor the rope from the ground while you climb\u2014and help you get comfortable. If you\u2019re going with an experienced friend who is belay-certified (you get certified by taking a class and passing a test), you may also choose to just hop right on the wall and have them help you. Any of these options are fine, and you should choose the one that makes you feel most comfortable. For most people, that\u2019s probably getting a little professional help.", "Typically, climbing gyms have both rope climbing and bouldering. Bouldering basically just means climbing on much shorter walls with denser crash pads below and requires only shoes, no harness; you can do it completely solo, so you might want to hop on the wall and give it a try when you first get there. It can help you get a feel for the handholds and how your toes really can grip onto the holds if you trust them.", "When you go climbing for the first time, you\u2019ll rent a harness and shoes. You may also get a chalk bag. Most harnesses are similar across the board, Mickey Ashmont, head coach at Gravity Vault Hoboken, tells SELF. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a waist loop and two leg loops, and you basically stand in the leg loops kind of just like putting on pants,\u201d he explains. Then you\u2019ll pull the strap around your waist to tighten it. There will also be a loop on the front of the harness\u2014that\u2019s where the belay attaches, so make sure that you put the harness on so it\u2019s in front. The harness should sit just above your hips. It takes some getting used to and does feel like a diaper at first, but you\u2019ll be walking around normally and forget you\u2019re even wearing it in no time.", "Perhaps weirder than the feeling of wearing a harness is the feeling of slipping into climbing shoes for the first time. They\u2019re going to feel like they\u2019re too small, by maybe a half size or so. They are meant to be snug; the idea is that the less shoe you have on your foot, the better you can feel the wall as you climb, which translates to getting a better grip on the holds. They should be mildly uncomfortable, but not painful, says Ashmont.", "Climbing shoes are typically worn sans socks, which, IMO, is a little disturbing if you\u2019re renting from the gym. (Honestly, how many feet have been in and sweat in those shoes? Shudder.) Luckily, Ashmont says it\u2019s totally cool to wear socks with climbing shoes when you\u2019re first starting. (Once you\u2019re doing more advanced climbs with tinier footholds, the foot-to-shoe contact matters a lot more, so you\u2019ll want to skip socks, but at that point you might just invest in your own shoes anyway.) Ashmont adds that a lot of people ask if they can just wear their sneakers\u2014and the answer is: nah, not really. Climbing shoes make a difference, so if you want to increase your chances of getting up the wall, use the rentals.", "And a quick note about chalk: It should be your friend. Its purpose is to remove moisture from your hands, says Ashmont, and it can really help you grip the handholds. A lot of people underutilize it, but you can also use too much, so aim to just have a thin layer of white on your hand as you climb.", "Ropes deserve their own section because you have to trust them to feel comfortable climbing. And I\u2019ll be totally honest here: It takes some time to trust the system. But once you do, getting up on the wall is a million times less scary.", "\u201cOur facility and other high-volume gyms have most of our top rope stations set up so there\u2019s really not a lot of work needed on your part in terms of setting the belay device up properly,\u201d TJ Ciotti, director of climbing at The Cliffs, tells SELF. But in my experience, it really puts your mind at ease to learn that the rope setup makes it so that you basically cannot fall.", "As I mentioned before, bouldering is when you climb up and around a rock wall without any kind of rope. There are crash pads under you, and you\u2019re typically not going very high. But when you want to top rope\u2014that is, climb high while using a system of ropes to keep you from falling\u2014you need to be belayed. When someone is belaying you, it just means that they\u2019re on the ground as you climb, and the rope that\u2019s attached to your harness passes through an anchor on the wall and clips into the belayer\u2019s harness. The belayer\u2019s job is to take up (and also let out) slack in the rope so that if at any time the climber falls, they fall only a short distance. These ropes systems are engineered to have a decent amount of friction so that even if the belayer isn\u2019t doing a perfect job, the climber is still safe.", "Once belayer and climber are tied in safely and have checked each other\u2019s work, climbing instructors suggest going up the wall just a few feet and then letting go and so you can experience how the rope can hold you. Doing this a few times will help you get a feel for how the system works and make it easier to trust it. I highly recommend doing this. I actually do it every single time I go to the gym before my first climb just to remind myself of how it feels to \u201cfall.\u201d", "Another option is to use an auto-belay when you\u2019re first getting started. An auto-belay is a device that\u2019s anchored to the top of the wall and automatically takes up slack as you climb. When you\u2019re ready to come down, the device catches you and lowers you slowly\u2014no second person needed. Leonard says they start a lot of beginners on these at Riverfront Rock Gym. It\u2019s a good way to focus on simply climbing without worrying about whether a belayer is doing their job right. You should also test falling with the auto belay so you can get a feel for it. Unlike when a person is belaying you, the auto belay sort of works like a seat belt: It feels like the rope won\u2019t catch you at first, but when you actually put your weight into it, it tightens up and keeps you from falling.", "Climbers and belayers have their own little language\u2014basically a bunch of calls and responses to make sure all safety measures have been taken before a climb starts, and it\u2019s secretly one of my favorite parts about climbing. The commands just sound so official (especially if you say them with real gusto), which feels out of place in such a casual setting\u2026and it makes me giggle every time. But they do serve an important purpose! \u201cCommunication is key. I really like stressing that,\u201d says Leonard. \u201cKnowing what the other person is going to do is kind of a backstop in making sure everyone has a good time and nothing bad is going to happen. Lack of communication is how a lot of accidents do occur.\u201d Gyms can be loud, and there are other climbers potentially right next to you, so it\u2019s extremely important to have good communication and establish a plan with your partner before anyone gets off the ground.", "Climbing commands are pretty standard across all rock gyms, so you\u2019ll likely hear (and be taught in any beginner class) this exchange that happens before the climb begins:", "Climber: \u201cOn belay?\u201d - This is the climber asking the belayer to confirm that they are hooked into the belay system properly.Belayer: \u201cBelay on.\u201d - The belayer will double-check the carabiner to make sure it is locked in place before saying this.Climber: \u201cClimbing.\u201d - This means the climber is about to start climbing.Belayer: \u201cClimb on!\u201d - This is the belayer confirming that they are ready for the climber to begin.", "Other commands you may learn:Climber: \u201cSlack!\u201d - The climber needs more rope to move comfortably.Climber: \u201cUp rope!\u201d - There\u2019s extra slack in the rope and the climber wants the belayer to take it in so the rope is taught.Climber: \u201cTake!\u201d - The climber is ready to be lowered down off the wall, so the belayer should take the climber\u2019s weight on the rope.", "This is not a complete list of the commands used in climbing, but a lot of the other ones won\u2019t really be needed in the gym and are more for outdoor climbing.", "One of the coolest things about climbing is that unlike other sports or activities where you have to really learn a movement pattern before you can do it, the movement is pretty intuitive; you look at a wall with a bunch handholds, and your body just knows what you need to do to get to the top. If you\u2019ve ever climbed anything before, you\u2019ll have the basic motion down.", "The thing that most people need to be reminded of, though, is to use their legs. \u201cA lot of people think climbing is all in the arms, but I would say it\u2019s actually all in your feet,\u201d says Leonard. He suggests that instead of looking at your hands and planning your next move based on them, focus more on your feet and think about how to walk yourself up the wall. \u201cThat way, you\u2019re using your leg muscles instead of trying to do pull-up after pull-up,\u201d he says. That\u2019s going to make climbing a lot easier.", "Ashmont notes that when you do an initial session with an instructor, you\u2019ll learn some really helpful form tips and be able to learn IRL what they feel like. A few things he says to keep in mind: \u201cKeeping your hips over your feet as much as possible is very helpful.\u201d Basically, keeping your center of gravity in the middle of your body and close to the wall will help you stay strong and in control of your movements. He also suggests keeping your arms as straight as possible when you don\u2019t need to actively use them, to reduce fatigue in your forearms.", "Speaking of forearm fatigue\u2026it\u2019s inevitable. \u201cOftentimes people who climb for the first time or two wind up sore, with body parts hurting that they never used before,\u201d Ciotti says. The reality is that unless you play another sport that requires a lot of grip and forearm strength, your body is not used to using these muscles so heavily. Your fingers, hands, and forearms are going to get tired really quickly. What I always experience is that I have to call it quits on climbing way before my legs and back get tired, because my hands and forearms have reached their limit. That\u2019s totally normal\u2014and Ashmont reassures that you\u2019ll notice improvement week after week.", "\u201cClimbing twice a week is ideal if you\u2019re really trying to see some quick improvement over the first couple of months,\u201d he says. \u201cBut even climbing once a week you will see an increase in form, endurance, and strength.\u201d", "And the best part, I think? Once you just go for your first session or two and learn how to climb safely, it\u2019s a sport you can do totally on your own terms. You don\u2019t need to rely on staff members at the gym throughout the rest of the process, Ciotti says. So you can go with a friend, or go solo and sign up to be paired with a partner at the gym (many climbing gyms have a belay-partner sign-up sheet), and get right in the harness and up on the wall. Before you know it, you\u2019ll stop overthinking (read: worrying about) every little thing and start feeling as at home in the climbing gym as an old pro.", "Related:", "SELF does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from climbing that also applies to follow-up communication.", "The best climbing requires clear and consistent communication. Though I may be alone up on the wall, I can\u2019t hesitate to call back down to my belayer. And they can\u2019t hesitate to talk to me. The key in business follow-up, just like it is in climbing, is talking just as often as you need to. Not more and not less.", "If a belayer talks too much, it can take the climber out of the zone. Or sometimes a climber simply wants to figure out the problem alone, without help from anyone else. But by not talking enough, the climber might miss a key move or an important warning. Similarly, a climber on a route with a lot of loose rock needs to yell \u201cROCK!\u201d or the belayer and anyone else down below is in for a truly nasty surprise.", "While having or not having a business conversation won\u2019t lead to physical harm for anyone \u2014 at least it shouldn\u2019t \u2014 you want to find that sweet spot of communication. Doing so allows you to make the most of your relationships with leads and customers. Finding the proper level of communication simply requires practice.", "I have a negative ape index, which is basically the difference between arm span and height. My arm span minus my height is almost -2 inches. As you might imagine, a shorter arm span can be a real inconvenience in climbing. But really all it means is that I need to figure out a different way to climb than some of my friends.", "Your follow-up is the same way. What works for someone else is only your starting point. Even what works for you at one point likely won\u2019t work forever (more on that later).", "When our consultants help Skipio clients plan their follow-up communication and campaigns, they generally know what works within a given industry. But each campaign is uniquely tailored to fit specific business needs. That\u2019s also why we\u2019ve always stressed that templates are just the start. They give you a framework to build on and personalize. And all your follow-up needs to be personalized.", "Many climbers have \u201cspecialties.\u201d Whether that\u2019s a type of rock they feel at home on or a type of hold that really suits their climbing style, climbers with a specialty simply excel when they climb in that way.", "For me it\u2019s crimps. They\u2019re exactly what they sound like: holds that make you scrunch up your fingers real tight. But as much as I love crimps, if I only climb routes of that style, A) my fingers will get real tired, real fast and B) I won\u2019t be a well-rounded climber. Nor will I ever find out if I enjoy or am good at another style of climbing!", "The same is true for your follow-up communication and business. If you interact with every person in the same way forever, your lead nurturing and customer engagement grows tired fast. When certain messages or timing results in quality engagement, definitely keep doing those things! But when you insist on only doing those things, you won\u2019t innovate or iterate.", "Growth stops when you do the same things over and over, so embrace trial and error.", "A big part of executing a successful climb is sequencing, which is essentially planning how to do the route. Novice climbers in the gym learn how to do this and legends like Tommy Caldwell rely on sequencing to send the big walls in Yosemite.", "Climbers sequence to work out exactly how to position their bodies, where to step, and how to put their hands for each section (known as pitches) of the climb. Climbers work routes for minutes, hours, days \u2014 or in Tommy\u2019s case years \u2014 to figure out the perfect sequencing.", "This happens because your initial sequencing only gets you so far. When you get on a route for the very first time, a hold that looked amazing from the ground (or even from a few feet below on the wall) suddenly becomes the worst thing you\u2019ve ever seen. In that moment you figure out how to use the bad hold or you find a new way up the wall.", "And sometimes when you get on the rock you discover holds you didn\u2019t even know existed. Suddenly a part that seemed impossible is suddenly opened to you. Being that close to the rock reveals things you would never have learned otherwise.", "That\u2019s how your follow-up should be. Make a plan. Try something out. But always be ready to jump in and change things. If your call to action sucks, rewrite it. If automated messages aren\u2019t working, change the timing.

After Nui (our guide) had set the first route and shown us the basics, it was our turn to head on up the wall!", "The cliff faces and rock formations were spectacular! The limestone has been shaped over thousands of years to create so many epic climbing routes for all abilities; one route even leads climbers into the mouth of a cave.", "There are also opportunities to boulder here, so whilst waiting for the others to make it to the top, we (mainly Will!) could try our hand at something a bit lower to the ground without the need for ropes. To me, the inexperienced climber, these walls looked completely flat, but another guide from Real Rocks, Rain, was on hand to show us where to grip onto the virtually non-existent cracks!", "As the morning went on and the weather cleared up a little, a crowd gathered behind us giving us a bit of an audience! Of course, this happened when I was about to do my first climb, and being afraid of heights, I was probably about to embarrass myself! However, I\u2019ll try anything, and with a little (a lot) of guidance from Nui, I managed to get into the swing of it\u2026 eventually!", "During the first half of the day, Will, being a fast climber, managed to complete three routes, while I did two (or one and a half because I chickened out of the first one!). For those with a bit of climbing knowledge, the grades of this first set of routes ranged from grade 4 to 6b+, and we climbed them on a Top Rope. As the name \u201cTop Rope\u201d suggests, the rope was secured at the top of the crag and New belayed (pulled the rope through and supported) us from the bottom.", "In between climbs, it was interesting to sit and watch other people taking on the walls. There were not only people from Real Rocks but also other climbing schools and some who had journeyed here solely to test out their skills at this famous haunt. These guys were so interesting to watch as they scaled walls, climbed up crevices and hung onto impossibly tiny pieces of rock in their efforts to make it to the top. They were extremely talented and fascinating to watch, we could see why an audience had gathered on the beach!", "After all the hard work it was lunchtime, and Nui gave us each 150 baht to spend on what we wanted. We walked along the bay until we came across a place where the owner was barbecuing chicken outside (she knows how to draw customers in!).", "There are quite a few choices of restaurants in this area, but we chose this one for the cheaper prices, variety of dishes\u2026and because it was home to an adorable two-week-old kitten! The kitten and the young boy who lived there chatted with each other and the kitten followed him around everywhere, it was so cute! After eating our fill of sweet and sour and fried cashew nut, and of course, cuddling the kitten, we headed back to find New and jump straight back into an afternoon of clambering up the crags!", "Our next climbing location was the famous 123 Wall. One of the earliest routes to be set at Railay, it\u2019s named for the days of shorter ropes, when the wall had to be climbed in three sections. Again, there was something for everyone here: short routes, easy routes, tricky routes and even a 52 m route called \u201cMassage Secrets\u201d that takes climbers up to stunning views across the bay!", "This area is popular with climbing schools, and as it was a slightly small space, we ended up having to dodge around people a little! At one point I found myself squidging into a hole to avoid someone on their way down, which turned out to be hilarious for the both of us and everyone on the ground!", "However, being busy also meant that everyone supported each other and congratulated climbers when they made it to the top or struggled over a difficult problem \u2013 a bit of motivation is sometimes the thing you most need when your arms and legs are shaking from the exertion!", "During the afternoon I made it up another one and a half routes, and Will topped three more! The grades of these ranged from 4 to 6a. As well as Top Roping, Will also got to try a different technique called Lead Climbing, which is where climbers attach the rope to bolts in the rock as they go along.", "At the top of the 52 m high route, which also happened to be Will\u2019s final route, his arms were starting to get tired after all the climbing. He was nearly at the top when his arms gave way and he fell off the wall! Nui, belaying from the ground caught him before he fell very far, but it was definitely a heart-stopping moment for his onlooking girlfriend!", "Eventually, Will made it to the top and was rewarded with breathtaking views of the limestone formations and the curving bay \u2013 he said he could have sat there all day taking it in, and I wish I could have done the same, except 52 m is just a little too high up for me!", "After we\u2019d had an amazing day and well and truly climbed ourselves to aching point, we caught a long-tail back to the mainland and made our way back to town for a much-needed shower and to rest our tired limbs!", "There\u2019s no other way to describe our day of climbing with Real Rocks Climbing School at Railay Beach than by saying that it absolutely rocked! It was one of the best tours we\u2019ve done with South East Asia Backpacker yet. The day was amazing because it\u2019s something that we could both do; we both enjoy climbing but have varying degrees of experience and our tolerance of heights is the complete opposite! The routes were epic, the climbs were so much fun and the views were something else.", "Our guide, Nui, was such a talented climber, a supportive teacher and an all-round great guy \u2013 in no time at all he sussed out everyone\u2019s skill level and gave us routes to match that, offering some which were easier but still testing for me whilst giving Will more challenging, gravity-defying climbs.", "There are so many routes to choose from at Railay, it\u2019s recommended to have a guide. Not only do the guides from Real Rocks clearly know their stuff, but the climbing is super safe and well within the means of the beginner climber, so even if you\u2019ve never climbed before in your life or you\u2019re a pro, they will make sure you have an unforgettable experience.", "Think you\u2019d like to climb with Real Rocks? Book your rock climbing experience in Krabi here.", "You can climb year-round in Railay and Tonsai in Krabi. Even when it is raining, there are sheltered climbing walls where you won\u2019t get wet as you climb. However, it gets extremely hot during the months of April and May. November to March is the best time for climbing as the weather is both dry and warm.", "The main tip for deciding what to wear when you go climbing is comfort. You want loose clothing but nothing that will catch during your climb. Be aware that you will be wearing a harness that will ride up so short shorts are probably a no-go! You can\u2019t go wrong with a pair of sports leggings and a light t-shirt though.", "Climbing gear and equipment rental is free for all Real Rocks customers but there is also the option to bring your own gear if you prefer. Climbing shoes are also provided.\u00a0Other companies may charge a rental fee for gear. Whenever you are renting equipment, always check its condition. In particular, you are looking for working carabiners and that the rope is intact with no excessive fraying. Always call out the company if they are providing dodgy equipment \u2013 you should never gamble with your safety!", "Most of the companies offering rock climbing trips in Railay and Krabi charge the same amount. Therefore, as there is no difference in price, you don\u2019t want to skimp on quality!", "When it comes to pricing, group tours are much cheaper than private ones. A half-day group rock climbing trip lasts for four hours and starts at around 1200 Thai Baht ($39 USD). A full day group trip tends to cost in the region of 2000 Thai Baht ($65 USD).\u00a0Private trips tend to be at least double the cost of what one person can expect to pay on a group tour.", "There are plenty of courses available which cater to all climbing abilities. Depending on who you book with, you can expect to pay between 7000-8000 Thai Baht ($230 USD \u2013 $260 USD) for a 3-day course.

Until recently it was a popular sport in Krabi. However, currently, you cannot do this in Railay, owing to the Thai authorities decision to close access to the rock climbing and cliff jumping site. All tour operators are currently being scrutinised, to ensure that they are adhering to safety protocol.

While most people only visit the desert during the dead of winter, you can find plentiful shade and good climbing temperatures at Red Rocks well into April most years. Check the guidebook for North Facing crags with a little exposure (wind), and if that isn't cool enough for you, nearby limestone zones like Mt. Potosi, Mt Charleston, and Clark Mountain are higher elevation and completely climbable even into the summer months. ~Jonathan Siegrist, pro climber and Red Rocks regular", "Get more Climb Like a Local destination guides and start planning your next climbing road trip!"]]}
