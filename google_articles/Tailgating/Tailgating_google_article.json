Tailgating, which primarily takes place in the United States, often involves consuming alcoholic beverages and grilling food. Tailgate parties occur in the parking lots at stadiums and arenas, before and occasionally after games and concerts. People attending such a party are said to be 'tailgating'. Many people participate even if their vehicles do not have tailgates.  Tailgate parties also involve people bringing their own alcoholic beverages, barbecues, food etc. which is sampled and shared among fans attending the tailgate.  Tailgates are intended to be non-commercial events, so selling items to the fans is frowned upon. Tailgating is often seen as a critical part of the sports experience in the United States. Because many American sports venues are surrounded by large parking lots, tailgating often takes place right outside stadium and arena entrances.", "Tailgate parties have spread to the pre-game festivities at sporting events besides American football, such as basketball, hockey, association football, and baseball, and also occur at non-sporting events such as weddings, barbecues, and concerts.[1][2]", "Tailgating typically involves the consumption of alcoholic beverages or soft drinks and the grilling of various meat products.  Popular tailgate party foods include picnic staples such as bratwurst, hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans, and cold salads like coleslaw or potato salad.  Some food products were created because of tailgate parties. A brand of pimento cheese, called Palmetto Cheese, got its start at Atlanta Braves tailgate parties.[3]", "Lawn games such as KanJam, cornhole, ladder golf, Polish horseshoes, Louisville Chugger, Jarts, washer pitching and Sholf are very popular during tailgates and tailgate parties. Lawn games are associated with tailgating primarily because of the simplicity in the game materials.[4] Lawn games carry the connotation of drinking games because of their presence during tailgates.[5] Other games that are often played include beer pong and flipcup.[6]  It is also common for fans to bring sports balls such as footballs, soccer balls, and the like to casually play with. Many tailgaters have external stereos or use their car's sound system to play music, and it is not unusual to see some tailgate parties hook up a television set and antenna/satellite to an electric generator so partygoers can watch other sporting events.", "In schools and communities throughout the United States, there are athletic departments, coaches and parents of student athletes who rely on post-game tailgating parties to build community and support for their program and team.[8][9] Smaller, underfunded programs are assisted by the voluntary participation of parents and friends to feed the team and coaching staff post-competition, which  establishes a strong core of support year after year.[citation needed]", "In 2007, the NFL angered many football fans by banning tailgating before the Super Bowl.[10] The NFL cited security risks, though many suspected it had more to do with corporate sponsored events than any real threat.[11] In 2008, an online petition[12] began circulating to encourage the NFL to lift the no tailgating at the Super Bowl policy. Members of the sports media[13] also questioned the validity of NFL's claim that security concerns was the real reason for the ban.", "In April 2019, Ontario, Canada Premier Doug Ford's staff announced the legalisation of personal alcohol consumption outside sporting venues across the province, in effect creating a framework for tailgating-style events. Many sporting venues lack large surface parking areas, though, so American-style tailgating culture is unlikely to take hold.

With nomadic tailgating, people carry backpack or similar bags, filled with snacks and beverages\u2014usually alcoholic ones, like beer\u2014and roam the tailgate parties that are held before sporting events (usually, football). The nomadic tailgater has no vehicle or \"home base\" of his own.

The practice of tailgating is so popular and so anticipated that, at times, it overshadows the game itself\u2014in fact, one study found that 10 percent of people who tailgate never end up going inside the stadium at all. But how did it become such an engrained part of the football experience?", "For two years, Notre Dame professors and anthropologists John Sherry and Tonya Bradford traveled around the country studying, observing and documenting how Americans tailgated. In their 2015 report, they compared the modern-day tradition to ancient Greek and Roman practices of fall harvest celebrations known as \"vestavals.\" Named after Vesta, the goddess of the hearth, these parties were held to enjoy the abundance of the fall harvest season. They were intended to bring the community together for an excessive feast of food and drink, perhaps for the last time before season turned bitter cold and food became scarcer. Comparing tailgating to ancient vestavals, Sherry told the New York Times that the \"football season starts at the end of summer, goes through fall and ends on winter's doorstep. Tailgating is an autumnal rite that celebrates abundance in the face of austerity.\"", "Related: America's Best Tailgating Cities", "While that comparison is relatively family-friendly, another pre-football version of tailgating occurred during France's Reign of Terror in the late 18th century. Families would show up early, before political executions to enjoy a meal al fresco. According to historian Stanley Karnow, those executions often took on a \"carnival atmosphere.\"", "The early American story of tailgating also took place far from a sports stadium. More than half a century before the founding of the NFL at the Battle of Bull Run in Manassas, Virginia\u2014the Civil War's first official conflict\u2014hundreds of Union sympathizers showed up to the battlefield armed with picnic baskets and wine to observe what they thought would be a small and inconvenient rebellion. One Union Captain reported that he observed a \"throng of sightseers\" having a good time including \"women who had driven out in carts loaded with pies and other edibles.\" This didn't end particularly well. Confederate troops overtook the Union, forcing a retreat. Many of these panicked soldiers ran head on into the tailgating crowd. Luckily, no civilians were killed but the chaos caused sufficient panic.", "The safer practice of football tailgating has its origins in the Ivy League, at least it does according to Yale alumnus and professor Thomas Bergin. According to Bergin's research, the first football tailgate was in 1906. Yale was having a winning season when they took on their rivals from Harvard. At this point, the car was still a relatively new phenomenon with only about 100,000 on American the roads (compared to over 250 million today). But considering the wealth of many Ivy Leaguers, it shouldn't be surprising that many fans showed up to Yale-Harvard game in cars\u2014many of which carried picnics. Those who were arriving on the train for the two o'clock game had not eaten their lunch and were hungry. When those eating their picnic spreads in their cars spotted the poor people who had missed their lunch, they invited them over to join in on their festivities.", "In their report, Sherry and Bradford write that tailgating is much more than eating in excess while waiting for the big game. According to the anthropologists, \"Tailgating is actually a very complex social, community-building exercise, not simply a wild party.\" Although, that also sounds like an excellent excuse to give your boss so you can eat burgers, drink beer and watch football nearly every weekend for two years.", ""]], "http://www.rentschlerfield.com/guest-services/tailgating": [{"h1": ["Tailgating"], "h2": [], "h3": [], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["HOME OF UCONN FOOTBALL", "Click here for the\u00a02018 Rentschler's General Tailgating Policy.", "General Tailgating Rules listed below:", "Copyright\u00a0\u00a9\u00a02020\t\t\tRentschler Field.\n\t\t\tAll Right Reserved\n\nSite Map Privacy Policy \na carbonhouse experience"]], "https://www.danielrrosen.com/tailgating-leads-to-colorado-auto-accidents/": [{"h1": ["Tailgating Around a Sports Event Is Fun; The Other Type, Not So Much"], "h2": ["Colorado Drivers Guilty of Aggressive Driving Behavior"], "h3": ["FREE CONSULTATION", "Tailgating Is Considered Aggressive Driving", "Colorado Tailgaters Are the Worst", "Seconds Count in Avoiding a Car Accident", "Local (303) 454-8000", "Toll-Free (800) ROSEN-911"], "h4": ["Get In Touch", "", "30+", "6000+", "$100,000,000", "Denver Law Office", "Other Locations", "Practice Areas", "Resources"], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["The Rosen News TeamJan 16, 2019", "A few years ago, research showed that drivers in Colorado ranked as the most dangerous tailgaters in the country.", "Each year for several months, you hear a lot about tailgating in communities with college or professional football teams, where fans gather around vehicles parked near the stadium to enjoy pre-game camaraderie. \u201cTailgating\u201d has an entirely different meaning on the highway, however, where it has become a leading cause of fatal auto accidents in Colorado and across the nation.", "Simply put, tailgating is described as driving in a way that puts you at risk of hitting a car that stops in front of you.

Some jurisdictions may require a minimal gap of a specified distance or time interval. When following heavy vehicles or in less than ideal conditions (e.g. low light or rain), a longer distance is recommended.", "There can be several reasons for tailgating.", "Tailgating can occur when a vehicle attempts to prevent another vehicle on the right or left from cutting in front of them. The tailgating (or preventing) vehicle will drive as close as possible to another leading vehicle to prevent the side vehicle from cutting in. Like all forms, this practice of tailgating is illegal and attempts to force the side vehicle to slow down and get into the line of traffic behind the tailgating vehicle. This practice is very likely to evoke road rage where one vehicle is blocking and another attempts to defy the block.", "Tailgating can occur because of a lack of perceived risk in so doing. Thus, it is done unconsciously or negligently, very often by people who consider themselves safe drivers and generally obey some other rules of the road. Evidence shows that more experienced drivers are more likely to be involved in rear-end collisions, possibly because they overestimate their skill and become complacent about allowing sufficient distance to avoid an accident.[2]", "In its most uncivil form, it can be a case of road rage and/or intimidation. An example would be where the tailgating driver (the driver in the following vehicle) threatens damage to the leading vehicle and its occupants by driving aggressively \u2014 perhaps also with use of headlights and horn \u2014 to coerce the leading vehicle's driver into getting out of the way. The driver being tailgated might not wish to comply, especially if doing so would involve breaking the law, such as by increasing speed beyond the speed limit or changing lanes without due regard for safety. Note, however, that in some jurisdictions (E.g., India) flashing high beams is a normal and polite method used to signal the intention to overtake.[1]", "A form of deliberate tailgating known as slipstreaming, \"draft-assisted forced stop\", or \"draft-assisted forced auto stop\" (D-FAS) is a technique used by some hypermilers to achieve greater fuel economy. D-FAS involves turning off the engine and gliding in neutral while tailgating a larger vehicle in order to take advantage of the reduced wind resistance in its immediate wake.[3] Note that this practice is extremely dangerous: while tailgating itself is inherently risky, the danger of collision is increased with D-FAS as power for power brakes can be lost after a few applications of the brake pedal and, with older cars, the pressure that causes power steering to function can be lost as well.[4]", "Another instance whereby the practice of driving on a road very close to a frontward vehicle or at a close distance may occur is during an occasion whereby the drivers of the two cars are acquainted to one another. This may be due to it being a procession of motor vehicles, typically carrying or escorting a prominent person that wants to avoid interlopers. Another instance may occur where the leading vehicle is showing directions to the trailing vehicle and the trailing vehicle attempts to avoid allowing an interloping vehicle to come in between them.[5] Another sphere wherein tailgating has been observed is among drivers who are in a hurry, or other public road activity whose prerequisite is urgency or agitation.[6]", "Tailgating can be dangerous to the tailgater, especially if they are driving closely behind a large vehicle (such as a tractor-trailer, or gas tanker). By tailgating, the driver has a shorter distance to stop, decreases the margin of error and blocks the awareness of surroundings.", "If the leading vehicle decelerates suddenly (such as when encountering a traffic jam, traffic lights, avoiding pedestrians, etc.), the tailgater has a high risk of causing a rear-end collision, for which in insurance terms, he would always be held responsible.  In many jurisdictions, a two second gap is recommended between any two successive moving vehicles, characterised in Britain by the slogan, \"only a fool breaks the two second rule\".", "Tailgating causes most rear-end crashes in South Australia.[7] Some motorways in the United Kingdom and Australia feature certain road markings which can help resolve this problem. Consisting of an arrangement of chevrons, these remind the driver not to tailgate, and assist in the two second rule.[8] There is also signage in Britain on smart motorways when they are very congested, to say \"stay in lane\u00a0: congestion\".  This is to remind motorists that there is, in these conditions, no longer an overtaking lane, merely a number of lanes, some moving faster than others at different points in time (undertaking by inner lanes being entirely permissible in this circumstance).  Those in the outermost lanes should, as usual, maintain a two second gap to the vehicle in front; as long as they do this, it is officially discouraged to change lanes.  Public goods vehicle licence training in Britain states that lorries should increase the 2 second gap to the vehicle in front to 3 seconds when being tailgated, to ensure that emergency braking can be a little gentler, to compensate for the tailgating vehicle behind having eaten up its own reaction time to almost nothing.", "In Germany, tailgating is punishable with a fine of up to \u20ac400. In case of gross negligence, one or more penalty points are given and the driver's license may additionally be immediately suspended for up to 3 months.[9]"]], "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-tailgating-gets-boot-stadium-plan-2010feb06-story.html": [{"h1": ["Tailgating gets boot in stadium plan"], "h2": [], "h3": [], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["Public Safety", "Pedestrian struck, killed on I-805 in Lincoln Park", "Public Safety", "Pedestrian struck, killed on I-805 in Lincoln Park", "It happened about 9:50 p.m. on north Interstate 805 between Imperial Avenue and Market Street", "", "Public Safety", "Pedestrian killed in San Diego Country Estates", "Public Safety", "Pedestrian killed in San Diego Country Estates", "Authorities said the victim \u2014 possibly a teenager \u2014 was struck by a white truck on Barona Mesa Road", "", "Public Safety", "Man stabbed outside Oceanside market; police search for attacker", "Public Safety", "Man stabbed outside Oceanside market; police search for attacker", "It happened about 6 p.m. Tuesday outside El Torito Market on Bush Street and San Diego Street, across from Joe Balderrama Park", "", "Health", "San Diego County sets a COVID hospitalization record as new surge hits home", "Health", "San Diego County sets a COVID hospitalization record as new surge hits home", "Sharp and Scripps facilities are taking the brunt of the increase so far", "", "Public Safety", "Massive stash of cartel cash, drugs and ammo seized from Otay Mesa truck yard", "Public Safety", "Massive stash of cartel cash, drugs and ammo seized from Otay Mesa truck yard", "Three Mexican nationals were arrested as part of a long-running investigation into the Sinaloa Cartel", "", "Education", "UC San Diego detects coronavirus in waste water samples from five areas of campus", "Education", "UC San Diego detects coronavirus in waste water samples from five areas of campus", "The school says the discovery could involve as many as 14 residence halls and two laundries", "", "Dining and Drinking", "New openings, closures and a cookbook on San Diego\u2019s restaurant scene", "Dining and Drinking", "New openings, closures and a cookbook on San Diego\u2019s restaurant scene", "News on DiCicco\u2019s Cork & Knife, ReBru, Sideyard BBQ, Royale, Amarin Thai and more", "", "Local", "Poll: Most San Diegans to stay put for Thanksgiving, avoid shopping", "Local", "Poll: Most San Diegans to stay put for Thanksgiving, avoid shopping", "Just 12 percent of the 500 San Diego residents surveyed said they would be traveling out of town for Thanksgiving holiday", "", "Music", "Grammys 2021: What you need to know about San Diego-bred nominees Anoushka Shankar, Gregory Porter and Alison Brown", "Music", "Grammys 2021: What you need to know about San Diego-bred nominees Anoushka Shankar, Gregory Porter and Alison Brown", "Two of the three former San Diego musicians are past Grammy winners", "", "More Coverage", "Entertainment", "Netflix cuts \u2018Chappelle\u2019s Show\u2019 loose, because Dave Chappelle wanted it that way", "Entertainment", "Netflix cuts \u2018Chappelle\u2019s Show\u2019 loose, because Dave Chappelle wanted it that way", "Dave Chappelle says \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d was licensed to Netflix and HBO Max without his permission or any payment.

On top, you could wear Under Armor, a T-shirt, a sweatshirt and then a jacket.

At 15m a driver will hit the back of the vehicle in front before having a chance to apply the brakes, and driving like this is, therefore, is extremely dangerous.", "Of course, this was in a test situation where real-world conditions such as the driver in front adjusting his speed to the vehicles in front of him perhaps wouldn\u2019t have been considered. When you drive very close to the vehicle in front, its change in speed will have a greater percentage difference to the distance between you. For example, if you are following at 40m and the vehicle head slows slightly and closes the gap by 4m, that\u2019s only 10%; if you are following at 16m and the same occurs, it has closed the gap by 25%. This means that you will be on and off the brake and throttle when travelling closely because you can\u2019t even out these fluctuations in the gap so easily.", "Additionally, the fuel savings are only relevant while driving in this situation, whereas the majority of driving tends to be in situations that would make this impossible.", "Use the two-second rule: As the car in front passes an object, count \u2018one thousand and one, two thousand and two\u2019 at normal speed. You should pass the object at the point where you would start saying three thousand and three. Or, say \u201conly a fool breaks the two-second rule\u201d, which should be about the same amount of time.", "If someone is tailgating you, particularly a much larger vehicle, you should leave a greater buffer between you and the car in front of you.", "You don\u2019t save much fuel by tailgating, and the risks outweigh the savings", "The two-second rule only works in situations where the vehicle in front has braking time, not when it stops abruptly.
