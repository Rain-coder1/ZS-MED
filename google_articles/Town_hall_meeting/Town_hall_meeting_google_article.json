In fact, some insist upon it: Texas for instance passed a law last year mandating that large school districts, cities and counties record audio and video of board, city council and commissioner meetings and post them online.\nMost civic-minded thinkers laud such tech implementations as a means to open the doors of government. But some worry about the flip side of remote access. When meetings all go online, will people stop attending in person? That could be problematic.\n\u201cThere is a dynamic that comes with social interaction. It\u2019s why people still go to shopping malls and churches. People need to interact, and that is heightened when you talk about democratic institutions, the ability to petition directly to your representatives,\u201d said Kevin Duggan, West Coast regional director of the International City/County Management Association.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine not having the opportunity to engage the public directly, to let the public meet directly with their elected officials,\u201d he said.\nIn fact, many in government continue to see value in the traditional face-to-face meetings. A strong majority of government supervisors (89 percent) say government meetings benefit citizens, according to the U.S. Travel Association.\nWhile some see technology as a valuable way to connect with those who can\u2019t make it to the council chambers on a Wednesday night, others are looking in a different direction. They are exploring ways in which technology can be used to enhance in-person meetings. Around the nation, municipalities are implementing instant-polling technologies, sophisticated agenda planners and speaker registration systems, all in an effort to make public meetings smarter and ultimately more effective.", "In Lucas County, Ohio, the Metropolitan Housing Authority is using virtualized computing to enhance its public meetings.\nThe housing authority represents the interests of some 17,000 individuals in 7,300 households. Its five-member board of commissioners meets at least once a month, and committees convene periodically to conduct business and hear from residents. Often the background materials needed to support a meeting can be overwhelming.\n\u201cThe board members may get a packet a week ahead of the meeting, and it will be this 100-page document. If they are volunteering their time, it can be a challenge to comprehend that much information,\u201d said housing authority CIO Craig Patterson. That challenge is compounded for ordinary citizens, who may only be seeing that information for the first time when they arrive at a meeting.\nRecently the board virtualized its desktops with Citrix XenMobile, a move that has made it easier for board members and the public to interact with information before and during meetings. \u201cNow we can give you a link on your iPhone or your tablet or your laptop, and you will have full access to everything, including all the multimedia, just as if you were a board member,\u201d Patterson said.\nBefore virtualizing the network, technical limitations made it difficult to share data in support of meetings. \u201cIf I tried to stream graphic-heavy video, it was going to look pixelated. It might not work at all,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cNow I can upload the video a week ahead of time, allow the public to look at it and think about it, and that in turn enhances their ability to actively and intelligently participate in the board meetings.\u201d\nNot only does the virtualized solution improve the quality of meetings, it also bolsters the bottom line. \u201cIn the past I would have had to buy a physical server and pay for all that capacity if I wanted to do something like this,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cNow with a virtual sever, for the days of the month when I am not having a meeting that server can scale down to next to nothing. So I am only paying for what I utilize.\u201d", "Meetings are as much about form as they are about content. What gets talked about, who talks, in what order: The agenda itself is very much the substance of the meeting, and not merely its form.\nThe commissioners of Brunswick County, N.C., recognize this and they take it seriously. They hold two \u201cagenda meetings\u201d a month for the purpose of setting the agendas for their two monthly public meetings. Those regular meetings can draw anywhere from 25 to 150 people, depending on the topic at hand, and a regular meeting of the commission may include upward of a couple dozen individual agenda items.\nThat\u2019s a lot of agenda to manage.\n\u201cAs a manual, paper process it was hard to update, it was hard to edit, it was not easy to distribute,\u201d said County Manager Ann Hardy. \u201cIt took a clerk in excess of 40 hours to put together agenda booklets, and as soon as the booklet went out, there would be a change that needed to be made, and there was no way to make a change.\u201d \nRecently the county adopted a fix in the form of cloud-based NovusAgenda electronic agenda management software. Now commissioners can access agendas on their mobile devices. Agendas, minutes, notes and supporting documents can be searched via a Web portal. The agenda creation and distribution process has gone paperless, and citizens have direct access to meeting schedules, past and upcoming agendas, minutes and notes.\nAny department head can access the system to create an agenda item through a workflow process of approvals that includes the county attorney, the finance officer and the county manager. In the past, this too was a paper-based system.\nBeyond merely paring back a labor-intensive process, the electronic system has enhanced democracy. \u201cNow the public can check the website, they can see what is on the agenda and have the chance to speak before the item is voted on,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt is a huge improvement.\u201d\nStill, the county has come to recognize the limits of its technology fix. \u201cThere have been dramatic moments when the Internet has gone down during a meeting, or the equipment has gone down,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have learned to plan for those things. You always save a PDF of the agenda packet on your local drive.\u201d", "Here\u2019s a problem with public meetings. Hand a microphone to just anyone, and you quickly attract a self-selecting group of loudmouths and narcissists.\n\u201cIn public meetings the person who walks up to that microphone is the one who thinks they have it right, the one who thinks they know the answer, and who therefore has the greatest bias,\u201d said Martin Carcasson, a senior public engagement fellow at the nonprofit Public Agenda.\nAs a professor of Communication Studies at Colorado State University, he trains students to facilitate public meetings and he said one of the most effective tools available to the government meeting-planner today is the simple clicker.\nA clicker gives you a way to organize a meeting quickly and efficiently. \u201cImagine I put up a PowerPoint with 10 things and everyone with a clicker can indicate their top three, in rank order,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a bunch of people want to talk about No. 2 and only a few people want to talk about No. 7, then I can assign tables quickly and organize around that. It allows us to balance breadth versus depth by finding out what people really want to talk about.\u201d\nWhere microphones \u201cspark a lot of individual opinion and typically cast a lot of blame, this creates a collaborative process, which in turn sparks accountability. It sparks a different kind of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cIn public meetings, process matters in terms of the quality of the communication you are going to achieve.\u201d\nCarcasson put this principle to work in Fort Collins, Colo., a big bike-riding community that came together for public meetings after two riders were killed on the road in the span of a week. Using clickers, meeting organizers were able to quickly sort out priorities and initiate brainstorming.\n\u201cAt the end of the meeting we could say: Here is the list of actions, here is the list of people interested in those actions,\u201d he said. \u201cChanges have actually been implemented since then by both the city and the biking community.\u201d\nCarcasson promotes the clicker as a way to get people working together, unlike other technologies that may enhance the volume of a public gathering, without really improving its quality. \u201cWe have lots of people talking, but very few people listening. Democracy requires us to interact, to actually listen to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often, technology just makes it easier for you to express your opinion, to \u2018get it out there.\u2019 And that can just create a lot of noise. Public processes cannot just be about input. They need to be public learning processes, where we get a more nuanced vision of the issues than we had at the beginning.\u201d", "Who gets to talk when? This is no trivial question in a large public gathering. Take for instance Orange County, Fla., where a robust government meeting may draw hundreds of participants. It\u2019s hard enough to keep track of everyone who might want to stand up and be heard. Now add in the fact that by county rules, any participant can \u201cdonate\u201d his or her allotted speaking time to someone else, and the logistics of the meeting will quickly swamp any paper-based registration system.\nCIO Rafael Mena has his eye on an electronic register that would replace the present paper-based system. A collection of responsively designed Web pages would be deployed to mobile tablets on standing pedestals for on-site sign-ups. The moderator and meeting-room monitors would manage the queue and text registrants to let them know the anticipated wait time until their turns.\nThe electronic system might also give county board members a way to recognize at a glance which speakers had come to the meeting as individuals, versus who would be speaking on behalf of companies. \u201cThis would be an electronic way to see exactly who the speakers are and how much time they have to speak. It\u2019s a way to handle the meetings more efficiently,\u201d Mena said.\nMena has no set timeline for the new system, having already contracted with a vendor once, only to have the project fall apart when the vendor ran into unexpected technical hurdles. \u201cThey found out it was more complex than they thought it was going to be, and now we are going to bid it out once more. But if we don\u2019t find a good solution out there, we will build it in-house,\u201d he said.", "In his previous role as city manager in Mountain View, Calif., Kevin Duggan saw a number of technologies emerging that promised to improve the quality of public meetings. He is particularly fond of new presentation tools that help participants visualize proposed plans and projects.\n\u201cIt used to be that someone brought in blueprints and sketches, or maybe built a model, but it wasn\u2019t a really good representation. For a big development project people want to get a deeper sense of what they are supposed to be looking at, what the real scale of it is,\u201d he said.\n\u201cToday you can have a computer-generated simulation where you literally walk around a project, walk through the buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes a whole different kind of experience.\u201d\nAs with many of the meeting-enhancement tools now emerging, these kinds of presentations do more than just give people a better sense of what a project looks like. In the best cases, technology reinforces the very nature of the public meeting as a place where government and citizens come together for a meaningful exchange of ideas.\n\u201cAll these things help deal with the perception that \u2018maybe we aren\u2019t being told the whole story,\u2019 the public\u2019s concern that maybe someone is playing fast and loose,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cIt goes to the credibility of the institution itself.\u201d", "Looking for the latest gov tech news as it happens?

After reading it, you will understand the basics of this useful communication skills tool.", "Town Hall Meetings derive their name from town halls. Town halls exist to serve everyone; from citizens to civil servants. This is also what the Town Hall Meeting is exactly about. It is a meeting intended for everyone in the organisation, in which management reports on policy matters, and employees are given ample opportunity to respond, ask questions and enter into discussions with managers.", "Many employees believe managers do not spend enough time explaining organisational policies and the plans and goals that accompany them. They experience this as a lack of transparency. However, this transparency is important to ensure a well-performing company. A Town Hall Meeting can help towards this. Improving transparency will influence the innovation and engagement of employees. Through Town Hall Business Meetings, the opportunity arises for discussion between employees and managers. In other words, it makes leadership more accessible. Such meetings can be offered on a quarterly basis. At the same time, they are also a welcome way to engage in discussion and strive for complete transparency in a less formal setting. A wide range of topics may be discussed; quarterly figures, milestones that have been achieved, new plans, topics that deserve additional attention or imminent competition. These are just a few examples.", "Town Hall Meetings may be held internally within the company. For example, in the company canteen. It is also possible to organise these meetings externally by reserving a (large) conference room. Alternatively, there is also the possibility of communicating with various branches simultaneously using video, streaming or other communication systems. Even employees who are in a different time zone can then join in and respond. In addition, a PowerPoint presentation may also be used, clearly showing agenda items and making the structure of the meeting clear.", "A good Town Hall Meeting should preferably be led by a moderator; this is a discussion leader who gives a brief introduction, asks questions and gives participants (employees in this case) the opportunity to answer. It is his/her task to involve the public in the discussion and to guide the meeting in the right direction. This can be manager or an externally hired person. It is the task of the moderator to give a short summary of what has been said, so that everyone understands the topic at hand.", "The goal of a Town Hall Meeting is more than just the presentation of company information. It is mainly about encouraging dialogue between managers and employees, so that everyone feels connected to the organisation. It gives employees an opportunity to make their voice heard and be part of the company.", "To involve every employee, it is recommended to organise a special Q&A session. For example, this can be done by using the so-called Round Robin method; a variant of the classic way of brainstorming. Everyone is given the opportunity to contribute, and all ideas are equally important. Beforehand, each participant is given the opportunity to shine his/ her light on the problem or relevant topic. Everyone writes their proposals and possible questions on a piece of paper. This gives everyone the opportunity to let their thoughts run free, and prevents anyone from being directly influenced by the ideas of others. It gives every employee the full attention of all managers and allows for sufficient time to ask questions and include follow-up questions. The questions are subsequently discussed during the meeting itself.", "A Town Hall Meeting can be structured in different ways. The step-by-step plan shown below usually works well. A structured meeting guarantees everyone feels heard and actively involved, with the main purpose being open communication.", "By announcing the Town Hall Meeting well in advance, every employee will become aware of it. This is precisely the intention. After all, the meeting is most effective if as many employees as possible participate. The announcement can be made in a variety of ways, including via the Intranet. It is recommended to mention that the presence and feedback of employees is more than welcome in making the meeting a success. In addition, during preparation, employees may already be asked to contribute anonymous questions and/ or feedback about company operations. This anonymity is inviting and ensures no employee will feel hesitant to speak his/her true feelings. In other words, it is the basis for two-way communication.", "By using an (online) survey, employees can express their ideas and opinions about the organisation in a different way. This survey is also completely anonymous. For example, the questions may concern the functioning of the department or organisation, potential improvements, suggestions and other topics related to management. Again, anonymity is important here to obtain honest answers. Employees must be free to provide answers and not be inhibited by the fact that managers will immediately know their name.", "During this phase, all data and questions from steps 1 and 2 are collected and integrated into the meeting agenda. It should be noted that it is essential that all questions and feedback are returned. If not, credibility with employees will be lost. The questions that cannot directly be answered during the Town Hall Business Meeting can be discussed at a different time.", "After discussing the agenda items, there will undoubtedly be various actions that need to be taken. By placing these in a realistic timeline, management demonstrates its commitment to promises. This will only encourage employees. They\u2019ll be taken seriously by the organisation, as a result of which they will continue to actively contribute. By means of a Town Hall Meeting, an organisation shows that it is committed and is willing to communicate with employees in an open and honest way.", "To make the Town Hall Meeting as effective as possible, there are a number of important preconditions to take into account. First of all, there\u2019s the PowerPoint presentation. By keeping the number of slides and amount of text per slide to a minimum, the audience will not get bored and employees will know the exact topic of discussion. Second, it is a good idea to maintain contact with the audience. A manager who relies too much on slides will lose eye contact. Moreover, it is also recommended to alternate heavier topics with lighter ones, so that a balance is created, and employees remain involved.", "By having as many managers as possible involved in the Town Hall Meeting, a company can transmit a positive signal to employees. Even though some of them may not be directly involved in the presentation, it allows for opportunity to discuss matters with employees in complete openness. As a result, everyone will contribute to the meeting.", "What do you think? Have you ever heard of a Town Hall Meeting? Do you recognize the practical explanation or do you have more suggestions?
