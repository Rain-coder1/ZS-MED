First of all, it is extremely rare to find in practice signals and sampling rates in harmonic numerical proportions. In our example, 3 identical simple signals are sampled across 8 sampling points. That's a harmonic 3:8 ratio. Secondly, there's almost no simple signals used in everyday sound applications that would benefit from extra harmonic content, and these complex signals are not identical.

Some people prefer to tune the drums to the track. Others feel it\u2019s more important to tune to the resonant frequency of the drum itself. As with most things musical, it comes down to using your ears, and what sounds best with the song.", "If you do opt to tune to the track, it\u2019s typically the snare that\u2019s most prominent. Many drummers use more than one snare during a session \u2013 metal or wood shell, deep or piccolo \u2013 depending on the pitch and tonal quality desired.", "Generally speaking, the biggest sonic issues with snare drums on a recording come down to resonance or rattling. If you\u2019re picking up excessive rattling from the snares, first check the snare wires themselves \u2013 are they straight and centered on the drum? Sometimes loosening the lower head slightly can reduce the buzzing of the snare wires. Typically, though, it\u2019s a resonant vibration from a tom that\u2019s causing the buzz. Try hitting each tom and listening to which one causes the problem. Retuning the offending tom slightly can reduce or eliminate the problem. (A muffling ring can also do the trick, though sometimes at the expense of good snare tone.)", "Tuning the kick drum can also be a challenge. Tune it too low and it will lack punch, too high and you lose power and thump. I like to get a good kick sound in the room, then address the kick drum sound with a combination of microphone choice, mic placement, and blankets.", "Tuning toms is a whole different animal. The challenge there is that, generally speaking, we like toms to ring \u2013 just not too much. And we like their ring to not affect adjacent drums. Often it comes down to the drummer\u2019s choice of heads. Some drum heads seem to exude a slight \u201cping,\u201d reminiscent of a basketball, which can be tough to eliminate or EQ away. Often this can be remedied by detuning the top or bottom head.", "Some drummers recommend tuning the top and bottom heads to different pitches to reduce resonance. I\u2019ve worked with a couple of studio drummers who try to tune the top head somewhere between a minor and major third higher than the bottom head. I say \u201ctry,\u201d because the pitch can vary a bit, depending on where you hit the drum. The pitch of the head will also drop as it\u2019s being played, and as temperature, humidity and other conditions change.", "In relation to the song, many drummers try and tune their toms at intervals around a fourth apart. This isn\u2019t bad for an average kit with two rack toms and a floor tom. With more toms it\u2019s probably a good idea to tune them closer, say around a third.", "Tuning stringed instruments is something of a compromise. The truth is it\u2019s impossible to tune a stringed instrument to a twelve-tone chromatic scale so that all possible intervals are perfect. This is particularly true with fretted instruments. In the end, the best we can hope for is to set up a guitar\u2019s intonation so that the most prominent intervals (octaves, fourths, and fifths) are true. At that point, the other intervals should hopefully be only microtones off, and hence barely audible.", "It should be a no-brainer to say that every stringed instrument player should use a tuner. I\u2019ve seen far too many musicians try and tune to a track by ear. Not only is this prone to error, it\u2019s just plain annoying and sometimes impossible. If you don\u2019t own a tuner, treat yourself to one. Today.", "There are several varieties of tuners, ranging from large, expensive (and somewhat outdated) strobe tuners to small plug-in boxes with analog meters, to tiny clip-on jobs with LEDs. For the most part, the lower-priced units tend to be okay for stage, but are less than accurate for studio work.\u00a0If you do decide to use an older tuner with an analog meter, it\u2019s important to keep it level when using it; tilting it will influence its accuracy.\u00a0Another suggestion would be to use the same tuner in a recording session to avoid the very real possibility that each person\u2019s tuner is giving slightly different readings.", "Some of the best and most accurate tuners are the rack-mounted units from Korg and Peterson, though they tend to cost a bit more. These days, many DAW programs, effects units, and even the control panels of some audio interfaces offer electronic tuner settings which can be quite accurate.", "Often a tuner can give a false or shaky reading, particularly those lower-priced LED units. To alleviate that problem, start by switching off all effects: reverb, EQ, etc. Select your guitar\u2019s rhythm (neck) pickup, rather than the lead (bridge) pickup. Roll the guitar\u2019s tone controls all the way down to eliminate the high notes. Finally, pluck the string gently right over the twelfth fret, instead of over the pickup.", "This technique works because you\u2019re eliminating most of the higher harmonics and generating the most pure, fundamental-rich tone. It\u2019s also why playing closer to the bridge generates a more trebley, twangy tone than playing near the sound hole or pickups.", "In doing this, it\u2019s very important to pluck the string very gently. Plucking a string hard will generate an attack that is sharper than the note itself.", "Of course, there are myriad other variables to consider when dealing with stringed instruments, including intonation. Try this experiment: play a 12th fret harmonic and compare its pitch with a fretted 12th fret note on the same string. Chances are good that the two pitches will be slightly off. A chord played on an instrument with poor intonation will sound right in one position, but the same chord further up the neck will be out of tune. A professional setup on the guitar\u2019s bridge can help alleviate this, but again, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to achieve perfection.", "Other issues to consider include temperature, humidity, and air pressure, all of which can affect an instrument\u2019s tuning. Then there\u2019s the fact that every instrument is unique \u2013 the type of wood used, particularly on the neck, can make a difference, as can the type and gauge of strings, the height of the frets, how the neck is attached, and of course, how a player\u2019s style affects an instrument\u2019s tuning.", "As you can imagine, there\u2019s a good chance that no matter how diligent you try to be, you may still run into some situations where tunings don\u2019t quite mesh. These days, there are plenty of ways to address the issue with technology. Pretty much every DAW (and most tape machines, if you still go that route) can alter a pitch or a track by microtonal increments, allowing you to tweak the tuning of a given track. And of course, there are several variations on auto-tune plug-ins as well.", "Any of these tools will enable you to fix tuning issues in the mix, and if you\u2019re so inclined you can get pretty surgical in your approach. But to what end? Just like quantizing rhythm tracks to soul-less perfection, tweaking every microscopic note of every part is the audio equivalent of chasing your tail until you lose sight of everything you ever loved about music.", "In short, there is no tuning perfection. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s not really the point. What\u2019s important is not whether every note and each harmonic are perfectly in tune, as much as how things blend together.", "As I say in pretty much every one of my columns, your ears are your most important tool.

Symphony orchestras and concert bands usually tune to an A440 or a B\u266d, respectively, provided by the principal oboist or clarinetist, who tune to the keyboard if part of the performance.[1]\nWhen only strings are used, then the principal string (violinist) typically has sounded the tuning pitch, but some orchestras have used an electronic tone machine for tuning.[1]", "Interference beats are used to objectively measure the accuracy of tuning.[2] As the two pitches approach a harmonic relationship, the frequency of beating decreases. When tuning a unison or octave it is desired to reduce the beating frequency until it cannot be detected. For other intervals, this is dependent on the tuning system being used.", "Harmonics may be used to facilitate tuning of strings that are not themselves tuned to the unison.[citation needed] For example, lightly touching the highest string of a cello at the middle (at a node) while bowing produces the same pitch as doing the same a third of the way down its second-highest string. The resulting unison is more easily and quickly judged than the quality of the perfect fifth between the fundamentals of the two strings.", "In music, the term open string refers to the fundamental note of the unstopped, full string.", "The strings of a guitar are normally tuned to fourths (excepting the G and B strings in standard tuning, which are tuned to a third), as are the strings of the bass guitar and double bass. Violin, viola, and cello strings are tuned to fifths. However, non-standard tunings (called scordatura) exist to change the sound of the instrument or create other playing options.", "To tune an instrument, often only one reference pitch is given. This reference is used to tune one string, to which the other strings are tuned in the desired intervals. On a guitar, often the lowest string is tuned to an E. From this, each successive string can be tuned by fingering the fifth fret of an already tuned string and comparing it with the next higher string played open. This works with the exception of the G string, which must be stopped at the fourth fret to sound B against the open B string above. Alternatively, each string can be tuned to its own reference tone.", "Note that while the guitar and other modern stringed instruments with fixed frets are tuned in equal temperament, string instruments without frets, such as those of the violin family, are not. The violin, viola, and cello are tuned to beatless just perfect fifths and ensembles such as string quartets and orchestras tend to play in fifths based Pythagorean tuning or to compensate and play in equal temperament, such as when playing with other instruments such as the piano. For example, the cello, which is tuned down from A220, has three more strings (four total) and the just perfect fifth is about two cents off from the equal tempered perfect fifth, making its lowest string, C-, about six cents more flat than the equal tempered C.", "This table lists open strings on some common string instruments and their standard tunings from low to high unless otherwise noted.", "Violin scordatura was employed in the 17th and 18th centuries by Italian and German composers, namely, Biagio Marini, Antonio Vivaldi, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber (who in the Rosary Sonatas prescribes a great variety of scordaturas, including crossing the middle strings), Johann Pachelbel and Johann Sebastian Bach, whose Fifth Suite For Unaccompanied Cello calls for the lowering of the A string to G. In Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante in E-flat major (K. 364), all the strings of the solo viola are raised one half-step, ostensibly to give the instrument a brighter tone so the solo violin does not overshadow it.", "Scordatura for the violin was also used in the 19th and 20th centuries in works by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini, Robert Schumann, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. In Saint-Sa\u00ebns' \"Danse Macabre\", the high string of the violin is lower half a tone to the E\u266d so as to have the most accented note of the main theme sound on an open string. In Bart\u00f3k's Contrasts, the violin is tuned G\u266f-D-A-E\u266d to facilitate the playing of tritones on open strings.", "American folk violinists of the Appalachians and Ozarks often employ alternate tunings for dance songs and ballads. The most commonly used tuning is A-E-A-E. Likewise banjo players in this tradition use many tunings to play melody in different keys. A common alternative banjo tuning for playing in D is A-D-A-D-E. Many Folk guitar players also used different tunings from standard, such as D-A-D-G-A-D, which is very popular for Irish music.", "A musical instrument that has had its pitch deliberately lowered during tuning is said to be down-tuned or tuned down. Common examples include the electric guitar and electric bass in contemporary heavy metal music, whereby one or more strings are often tuned lower than concert pitch. This is not to be confused with electronically changing the fundamental frequency, which is referred to as pitch shifting.", "Many percussion instruments are tuned by the player, including pitched percussion instruments such as timpani and tabla, and unpitched percussion instruments such as the snare drum.", "Tuning pitched percussion follows the same patterns as tuning any other instrument, but tuning unpitched percussion does not produce a specific pitch. For this reason and others, the traditional terms tuned percussion and untuned percussion are avoided in recent organology.", "A tuning system is the system used to define which tones, or pitches, to use when playing music. In other words, it is the choice of number and spacing of frequency values used.", "Due to the psychoacoustic interaction of tones and timbres, various tone combinations sound more or less \"natural\" in combination with various timbres. For example, using harmonic timbres:", "More complex musical effects can be created through other relationships.[3]", "The creation of a tuning system is complicated because musicians want to make music with more than just a few differing tones. As the number of tones is increased, conflicts arise in how each tone combines with every other. Finding a successful combination of tunings has been the cause of debate, and has led to the creation of many different tuning systems across the world. Each tuning system has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses.", "It is impossible to tune the twelve-note chromatic scale so that all intervals are pure.  For instance, three pure major thirds stack up to 125/64, which at 1159 cents is nearly a quarter tone away from the octave (1200 cents). So there is no way to have both the octave and the major third in just intonation for all the intervals in the same twelve-tone system. Similar issues arise with the fifth 3/2, and the minor third 6/5 or any other choice of harmonic-series based pure intervals.", "Many different compromise methods are used to deal with this, each with its own characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages.", "The main ones are:", "Tuning systems that are not produced with exclusively just intervals are usually referred to as temperaments."]], "https://www.benningviolins.com/the-history-of-standard-violin-tuning-who-standardized-it-why-and-when.html": [{"h1": ["Articles", "The History of Standard Tuning: Who Standardized it, Why, and When?"], "h2": [], "h3": ["HOURS", "MEMBERSHIPS", "TRANSLATE OUR SITE", "ON TWITTER", "CONTACT US"], "h4": ["", "The A note changed over the centuries due to concert hall architecture, instrument innovations, and the globalization of Western music."], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["Violin strings are typically tuned by setting the A string to 440 Hz.

But with the railroads, it became more important to have coordinated schedules for arrivals and departures. This is when standardized time zones came to be.", "The analogy to musical standard tuning finds its forensics in old pipe organs and old tuning forks. Organs in Germany that were built prior to 1600 had the A above the middle C varying between 377 Hz to 567 Hz, roughly a half note above and below the current 440 Hz standard.", "What changed this was the rise of the star composer-musicians Handel and Mozart, who themselves and their scores traveled farther than their predecessors in the 17thand 18thcenturies. They favored a standard pitch of about 422-423 Hz. This was followed by improved building methods of concert halls that satisfied larger audiences in the 19thcentury, which coincided with the development of new and better instruments. To achieve \u201chigh, brilliant pitches at climaxes\u201d (according to Lynn Cavanagh,\u00a0A brief history of the establishment of international standard pitch a=440 hertz), which worked better in these bigger venues, wind and stringed instruments were built to a higher pitch standard.", "It took the French to codify this, according to Cavanagh. \u201cIn 1859, a French government commission made A=435 Hz law in that country,\u201d she writes. Still, British musicians didn\u2019t exactly comply, nor did piano makers in North America, as they argued that room temperature rendered the French standard irrelevant.", "Again, it was a technology, radio broadcasting, which drove an international agreement in 1939. Europe was in catastrophic turmoil during that period, so it\u2019s interesting to note that consensus on the pitch of the A was at least achieved then. Today, it\u2019s possible to get the standard pitch for the violin\u2019s G, D, A, and E notes online and through phone apps.", "Given all that happened in Europe in the 20thcentury, consider how some of those centuries-old German, French, British and other pipe organs may well hold a stubborn adherence to different, non-standard tuning.
