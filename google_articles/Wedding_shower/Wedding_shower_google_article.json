A frequently quoted legend traces the origin of this practice to the 16th or 17th Century Netherlands. However, there are also parallels with many dowry practices and the United States colonial or hope chest (trousseau) custom.[1]", "A related custom practised in medieval England was the Bride Ale: in Langland's Piers Plowman (\u00a7 B.II.45) there is a reference to a bruydale. This was a feast held before the wedding day, at which the bride made beer and sold it to the guests at a high price.", "In the United States, bridal showers started in urban areas in the 1890s mainly among the upper middle classes.  By the 1930s, bridal showers had spread to rural America.[2]", "The earliest use of this sense of the word in print may be in the Grand Rapids Michigan Evening Press 22 June 4, 1904: \"The \u2018shower parties\u2019 that through mistaken hospitality the wedded couple are forced to attend ...\" and may derive from the custom in Victorian times for the presents to be put inside a parasol, which when opened would \"shower\" the bride-to-be with gifts.[3]", "Many different customs have developed in different regions and social groups, but the basic format has been relatively unchanged for generations, and emphasizes traditional gender roles.  Sociologists like Beth Montemurro write that the ritual of the bridal shower \"socializes women into the hyper-feminized traditional wife role,\" with its emphasis on the future role of the bride-to-be as family cook, homemaker, and sexual partner.[4]  Historian Elizabeth Pleck echoes this dynamic in pointing out that traditional shower gifts were \"for the bedroom or the kitchen.\"[5]  But this role is more of an homage to the mothers and grandmothers than a reflection of how the bride-to-be will actually behave in the marriage.[6]", "Although the format has remained relatively consistent, there have been some significant changes.  An etiquette guide from the 1920s suggested showers should be \"purely spontaneous and informal,\" with guests arriving unannounced at the bride-to-be's home, while a planning guide from the 1950s suggests more complex themes and games.[4]", "Showers are often held during the afternoon or evening, but not generally as luncheons or dinner parties.  They commonly take place four to six weeks before the wedding.[7]", "Due to the prior history of showers being \"purely spontaneous and informal\", showers have not developed the same formal etiquette that has developed with respect to weddings.  Invitations may be issued informally, by mail, telephone, or e-mail.", "As showers are explicitly a gift-giving occasion, everyone who attends the shower is expected to bring a small gift.[8]  People who decline the invitation for any reason are not expected to send a gift or otherwise participate in the party. The hosts are expected to hand over gifts, or favors. These can be small gifts like chocolate coins that have been personalized with the name of the bride and the date of the event or a simple thank-you message.", "Food can be served at bridal showers. Treats such as cake and candy buffets can also be served for guests.", "Hosting the bridal shower falls to one or more close friends of the bride, often one or more of the bridesmaids.  Close family members traditionally did not host bridal showers, however, it has become commonplace for mothers of the bride and groom or other members of the family to host or contribute to the event.[9]  Some organizations, such as social clubs or religious groups, host bridal showers for every member who is being married.", "Guests are chosen from among the bride's personal friends, family, and other well-wishers. Men are not usually present at bridal showers.", "The number of guests and their relationship to the bride varies widely.  In Canada, among some immigrant communities parties in community halls with upwards of 300 guests were normal, while other cultures emphasized intimate parties with only close friends and relatives.[10]", "In general, people who are invited to a bridal shower are also invited to the wedding ceremony.", "Though many cultures have events before the wedding, bridal showers are most common in the United States and Canada.", "In the United Kingdom, bridal showers have been described as a \"consumerist American idea\" with \"limited acceptability\".[11]  In the UK, wedding presents are normally selected from a list provided by the couple, and delivered either at the wedding or by the shop, and sometimes displayed at the wedding. Nonetheless, bridal showers are sometimes held, and shower-planning services are frequently offered by wedding planners.", "In Australia and New Zealand, a custom related to the North American bridal shower, known as a Kitchen Tea, was traditionally held before the wedding. During  a Kitchen Tea, female friends and family members would gather at the bride's family home for an afternoon tea, where they would give kitchen-related gifts to the bride. Recently, the influence of American culture has seen a rise in the prevalence of American-style bridal showers as opposed to the traditional Kitchen Tea.", "In India, Mehndi is a bridal-centric pre-wedding event where the bride's female friends and family gather to prepare the bride for the wedding. In the event the bride's traditional henna tattoos are made.[12]", "In Denmark and Germany, the only pre-wedding events commonly held is a bachelorette party for the bride and a bachelor party for the groom."]], "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/848295279790423875/": [{"h1": [], "h2": [], "h3": [], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, []], "https://www.papersource.com/greeting-cards/before-the-i-do-bridal-shower-card-10002572.html": [{"h1": ["Before the I Do Bridal Shower Card"], "h2": ["You May Also Like"], "h3": ["Add coordinating Items"], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["JavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.

So we talked to etiquette expert Diane Gottsman to get all the answers on what happens at a bridal shower and how to plan one. While it can get a little overwhelming, especially if you're tasked with planning the event, remember that it's only meant to be a fun way for the bride to celebrate with those closest to her. \"A bridal shower is designed to shower the bride with good wishes, congratulations, and some gifts,\" Gottsman says.", "Meet the Expert", "Diane Gottsman\u00a0is a national etiquette expert, author of\u00a0Modern Etiquette for a Better Life, and founder of\u00a0The Protocol School of Texas.", "As a longtime favorite pre-wedding event, bridal showers can be both exciting and daunting to plan for. From choosing the shower decorations, planning games and activities, choosing a location, and making the food and drink menu, to picking a shower gift she'll love (yes, hosts still get gifts), we've got you covered. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to plan the perfect bridal shower.", "\"Depending on the taste of the bride, the host can have some entertaining games for the guests to play or skip the games altogether,\" says Gottsman. The general outline is usually the same: Food, drinks, and an opportunity for the bride to open gifts surrounded by guests. You can stick to bridal shower traditions like gift bingo or designing wedding dresses using rolls of toilet paper, or you could instead plan an activity-oriented shower like a spa day or a calligraphy lesson. Don't love the idea of opening gifts in front of everyone? Speak up! Those gifts could be set aside so you can open them at home along with your future spouse. Speaking of your partner, they often arrive toward the end of the shower (with flowers in tow) as a surprise for the bride. It's a sweet way to include them in your celebration, as well as help you get those gifts home.", "Usually, the bridal shower is held between two to six months before the wedding. Choose a date that is convenient for both the bride and her guests of choice, whether that means hosting something a little farther in advance or planning it to coincide with a trip home or another get-together, such as a bachelorette party in the evening after an afternoon shower.", "The bridal shower is usually hosted by the maid of honor, close friends, bridal attendants, or bridesmaids. No matter who is hosting, be sure to communicate clearly to make sure you aren't planning two separate showers. Traditional etiquette says the mother or mother-in-law (or any relatives, for that matter) should steer clear from hosting as it can appear that they are directly asking for gifts. However, today it's become much more common and perfectly acceptable for anyone to host who wants to.", "If family members aren't available to help plan, the bridesmaids should step in to help take care of some of the arrangements.", "Unless it's a complete surprise shower, the person being showered will generally provide some basics that they'd like at their shower. The host will ask about preferred themes, details, date, time, location, and activities to get an idea of where to start. It's up to the host or hosts to use that input to bring the shower to life.", "As with other pre-wedding events, the guest list should be limited to people who are also invited to the wedding. \"You can invite whomever you would like from the wedding guest list. Keep the guest list small and manageable don\u2019t have too many showers and don\u2019t invite the same people to multiple showers,\" says Gottsman. \"If someone is not invited to the wedding, they should not be invited to the shower.\"", "For the bridal shower, this usually includes the bridal party and the couple's family and close friends. The number invited depends on how large the event is intended to be. If the shower is going to be a surprise, the maid of honor and the bride's mother should work together to come up with a guest list they think the bride will be happy with. Otherwise, they can have the bride assist them with the guest list, then keep her out of the rest of the planning.", "Ideally, the invitations should be mailed out four to six weeks before the bridal shower, either by post or email. Make sure to include the bride's name, the date, the time, the location, registry information, a way to RSVP, and the names of whomever is hosting.", "A bridal shower can be as formal or casual as you want it to be, but it's best to at least include some sort of guide in the invitation. \"There's not one particular dress code,\" says Gottsman, \"but it's always better the dress up than down.\" If there's no indication of the event's formality, it may be more comfortable to show up overdressed than underdressed. If cohesion in your shower photos is important to you, it's a good idea to think about what the guests will be wearing and make a note somewhere within the invitation.", "If the bride still lives relatively close to home, the shower can be held in her hometown. Does she live in another state? It may still be more convenient for the bride to travel to her shower if most of the guests live locally, instead of asking the entire guest list to hop on an airplane. The specific location depends on the type of shower and the host's budget. It could be in a friend or family member's home or backyard, at a local restaurant, or somewhere more specific if the shower has a theme (such as a cooking school or a wine tasting room).", "No matter the selected date, make sure that the bride has put together a wedding registry before the invitations are sent out so guests can purchase gifts.", "It doesn't have to, but it's a fun way to add some personality to the party. A theme could be as simple as cohesive, rustic d\u00e9cor, or you could go all out with a spa day. Some of our favorite themes include a bridal tea party, a Disney-themed shower, or a Parisian-influenced affair.", "Not necessarily. The actual wedding registry can also function as a bridal shower registry. If, however, it's a lingerie shower, that would require a separate registry should the bride want to register for specific lingerie. As a bridal shower guest, it is in good etiquette to purchase a shower gift off the registry.", "The very first step to plan a bridal shower is to create a budget for the entire process. This includes food, drinks, d\u00e9cor, venue, rentals, event design, photography, videography, and any other vendors or expenses incurred while planning. Depending on the type of shower and what the bride wants, a typical bridal shower can cost anywhere from $10 to over $100 per person.", "Consult with the bride to choose a date that works for her and fits the wedding timeline. Aim for a minimum of a couple of months before the wedding. Keep in mind other events of the wedding like the bachelor/bachelorette party, which some couples plan for the evening of the shower day.", "Get a must-invite list from the bride and work with her as you create the full party guest list. Have the bride double-check and approve the list before you send out invites.", "You may decide to opt-out of a bridal shower theme, but if the bride is a wine-lover or cooking connoisseur, you might consider choosing a theme that follows suit. This will guide your planning decisions for the rest of the process.", "Often the host will offer their home to hold the bridal shower. If this isn't an option, see if another guest or co-planner has an available space. You can also choose a venue that correlates to the theme, like a spa or a winery, or you can host at a restaurant or hotel, or rent an Airbnb.", "Give guests as much notice as possible so they'll be able to attend the shower and purchase gifts. This should be done about four to six weeks before the shower date, which means you should start looking for and purchasing invitations at least a few weeks prior to then. It's also a good idea to include a line on the RSVPs for guests to note any dietary restrictions.", "The food will depend on the shower's theme and time of day. Hosting a brunch affair? Stock up on mimosas and breakfast foods. Whatever the menu, make sure it's something you know the bride will like and includes options for any food restrictions the guests note on their RSVPs.", "If you've hired a professional event designer, this part will be pretty breezy for you. If you're decorating yourself, this is arguably one of the most fun steps in planning a bridal shower. Whether you're following a theme or not, think about what kinds of personal touches you can include for the bride. We love pretty floral and balloon installations\u2014and don't forget a picture-perfect photo backdrop.", "Games are a great way to break the ice when guests first arrive if they are not already acquainted with one another. With a lot of traditional shower games, there is no purchase necessary\u2014just a bit of creativity! If your budget allows, there are also tons of super fun shower games we love that are available on sites like Etsy.", "Get everyone in the party mood with a fun selection of music.

Throwing a pig roast in a Manhattan studio, just because the bride loves a good luau, probably won't go as planned. Know that practical can be just as fun. For example, you can throw a honeymoon-themed party, where guests gift the bride with accessories, tools, and clothes fit for her first newlywed getaway. You could serve honey-flavored foods and play on the word \"honey\" throughout the party.", "Don't invite who you want, or even who you think\u00a0that the bride wants. She doesn't have to know who's coming (a surprise visit from the grandmother that she thought couldn't make would be amazing), but she should approve of everyone on the guest list.", "Whether you celebrate at someone's home, a restaurant, or a getaway destination doesn't matter, as long as it's somewhere that attendees can feasibly get to and offers the right vibe (read: fun) for your festivities.", "Set some sort of standard for your celebrants' attire, whether you pick out a color palette or ask them to dress to a certain level of formality. It makes photos that much better! That being said, don't push their buttons by expecting anything unreasonable.", "As for the bride, we're partial to wedding-white.

She can hold onto it as a keepsake forever!", "Lulls in conversation are inevitable when hosting guests from all walks of a bride's life (her college roommate Karen might have yet to meet her Aunt Betty). Fill the air with on-theme songs to keep the energy up. Ask the bride to make a playlist of her favorite hits, or create a rundown based on the chart-toppers of every year since she was born. Another route is to let the groom create an original playlist, so that he has a subtle\u2014but sweet\u2014hand in the day. You can\u00a0also launch a playlist on Spotify, or another streaming service, a few weeks in advance of the party, and let partygoers subscribe and add songs\u2014or simply listen in to get into the party spirit.", "Signage is a great way to really drive the theme home. Bonus points for cheeky wording, like this \"Ash Gone Mild\" slogan for a bride named Ashley's shower.", "We're under the impression that flowers are involved in too few of life's big moments. Cheery blooms are never not appreciated, and you can even send them home with the bride and/or her guests.", "It's the little things that count, and that'll make your event stand out, like personalized tags at each seat.

We personally love fruity and floral cocktails, though fruit- or flower-infused water is just as classy.", "Consider the theme and the bride's last-meal-on-earth dish to dream up a spread that packs flavor, style, and creativity\u2014and doesn't break the bank. Let one dish steal the show. If the bride is crazy for barbecue, then order brisket from her favorite smoker and fill out the spread with condiments, biscuits, and sides bought from a local grocery store or made at home. Above, an ice cream bar stocked with artisanal pints was rounded out with generic candy, bought in bulk.", "Instead of hiring a full wait staff, save money and keep things intimate by letting guests serve themselves (they can even make the food, if that's what you all agree upon!). The one exception? A person to man the drink station. Paying a mixologist or friend to serve a signature drink and work a light bar will keep guests where the action's happening\u2014and not in line for a cocktail.", "Just because you can get away with serving yourselves doesn't mean that you should use ugly paper or plastic plates and utensils to do so. Consider renting eye-catching dishes, silverware, and glassware, but don't worry if you can't swing it. There are tons of good-looking disposable options out there for everything from bowls to napkins.", "If even the mention of a \"shower game\" makes the bride cringe, a good alternative is a hands-on craft for partygoers. At this shower, celebrants engaged in the super-cool\u00a0process of making their own lipstick.", "You don't have to go wild with decorations to make your party pretty. Little things (like an easy-to-create backdrop of streamers) are all that it takes.", "If the bride in question is going to be opening gifts during the f\u00eate, make sure that she's comfortable. It doesn't hurt to turn her seat into a work of art, either\u2014she's the queen of the day and deserves a throne! This special chair was planned by\u00a0Blue Skies Events Nola and featured Bee's Wedding & Event Designs\u00a0flowers.", "Presents shouldn't all be china and linens. But here's the catch: The bride\u00a0should know what theme's coming, so that she can stock her registry with relevant items that she also wants. Bridal showers are thrown about three months before the wedding, so her registry (if she's lucky!) will probably be slightly picked over by then. Give her a prompt to fill out her wish list.", "No meal's complete without dessert, and definitely not this one! Satisfy everyone's sweet tooth with the special guest's favorite treats.", "Definitely invite the groom to show up when the party's nearly over, but not empty-handed. He can bring along a bouquet, a bottle of bubbly, or something for the crowd, like mini desserts, or his groomsmen if they live in\u2014or are visiting\u2014town. It's a fun way to follow tradition by keeping the shower ladies-only, then letting the boys and girls mingle later, without throwing a full-on \"couple's shower.\"", "If you're going to do favors, make the money worth it.

A bridal shower is often a fun afternoon, but some brides might feel uncomfortable with all the attention or greedy for asking their friends and family for more gifts.", "A bridal shower is typically hosted by the\u00a0maid of honor. Many etiquette guides frown upon family-member-hosted bridal showers because it may be seen as rude or greedy for the family to ask for gifts for their own relative; in recent years, however, it's become completely acceptable.", "Unless it's a surprise, involve the bride in the planning process. Ask her to create a registry if she hasn't already done so. Maybe she has a particular shower theme in mind, like a lingerie shower, a kitchen item shower, or an around-the-clock shower in which guests are assigned a time of day for selecting a gift.", "For an informal, casual shower\u00a0the host generally picks up all the costs, but for a more elaborate shower the host may talk to the other bridesmaids at the beginning of the planning process and ask them about chipping in or splitting costs. Beyond financial assistance, the host can and should ask the bridesmaids to help plan, set up, decorate, etc.", "In some cases, it's appropriate for all guests to pick up a portion of the costs for a shower. For example, an invitation to a restaurant bridal shower might read, \"We'll celebrate with a Dutch lunch (entrees cost about $10), followed by cake and champagne in the garden.\" A spa invitation might read, \"We've got the room reserved at XYZ spa. Call the spa directly to book your appointment. Instead of a present, please bring $25 to pay for the bride's treatments and send her on her way with a deluxe spa gift certificate.\"", "A bridal shower can take place anywhere. Traditionally it is held at the host's home, but any place works; popular options include a favorite restaurant, park, or banquet hall. Depending on the size of the guest list and the bride's preferences, showers can also be held at a paint-your-own-pottery studio, beauty salon, spa, or gallery.", "A bridal shower can be held anywhere from six months to a week before a wedding. If many guests are traveling from out of town, it may make sense to have it closer to the wedding so they can attend. Otherwise, four to eight weeks before the wedding is a good rule of thumb: it adds just enough anticipation, without creating more stress for the bride.", "Any time of day is acceptable for a bridal shower. Many bridal showers are held during the afternoon or early evening as a luncheon or dinner party. Brunch bridal showers are not uncommon either.", "You want to be absolutely sure that you're not inviting anyone to the shower who isn't invited to the wedding, and the only way to know that is to get the\u00a0guest list. Ask the bride for a copy, or, if the shower is a surprise, ask her mother or fianc\u00e9.", "Remember to invite close female relatives of both the bride and groom, as well as all the women in the wedding party and the bride's close friends. While bridal showers\u00a0guests are traditionally all women, today many are coed affairs that celebrate both the bride and groom, known as \"Jack and Jill\" showers. Before making a decision about whether to include men at the show, discuss the question with the groom-to-be to be sure that he is comfortable attending a shower and to ask for an appropriate male guest list if the answer is \"yes.\"", "Most of the bridal shower will be spent eating, laughing, telling stories and opening presents. Food can be as simple as light bites, crudit\u00e9s,\u00a0and sweets, or as elaborate as a themed spread that celebrates the couple.", "As the bride open presents, have some nice music playing in the background. Make thank-you-note writing easier by assigning someone to write down the gifts and their giver. Fun\u00a0bridal shower games\u00a0are a great way to keep the party moving if they're conducive to the event space."]], "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/230598443400662587/": [{"h1": [], "h2": [], "h3": [], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, []], "https://weddingplanningpodcast.co/unique-bridal-shower-ideas/": [{"h1": ["Unique Bridal Shower Ideas"], "h2": ["Podcast Library", "UNIQUE BRIDAL SHOWER IDEAS, The Ultimate Guide | episode dated 4.3.19", "First, what is a bridal shower?", "Who hosts the bridal shower?", "Who\u2019s invited to the bridal shower?", "When does the bridal shower take place?", "Do I have to have a bridal shower?", "Bridal Shower Gift Etiquette", "A very special thank you to today\u2019s show sponsors!", "Post navigation"], "h3": ["Listener question re: WHO SHOULD HOST", "A note on \u201cbridal shower\u201d invitees \u2026", "Listener Question re: Bridal Shower Timing | Multiple Showers", "UNIQUE BRIDAL SHOWER IDEA #1", "UNIQUE BRIDAL SHOWER IDEA #2", "Do I register for shower gifts?", "Bottom line on bridal shower gift etiquette \u2026", "www.newspaperclub.com", "Visit zebit.com/wedding for $2500 interest free credit", "Leave a Reply Cancel reply", "Now your first-time officiant friend or family member can WRITE + DELIVER your wedding ceremony like a pro!\u00a0 \u00a0Click here to LEARN MORE.", "Yes!

If you're wondering who pays for the bridal shower, or who hosts it, we've got the answers. Keep in mind that there are no strict rules when it comes to planning this prewedding event. Anyone can host the shower and help cover the cost if they'd like. The event can be held for the bride or for the couple\u2014it's up to you.", "There are also endless bridal shower themes to choose from: wine tasting, cooking classes, tea parties and even black tie dinners. With so many possibilities, communication is essential for planning a wedding shower. To help you get started, etiquette expert Elaine Swann responds to questions such as who hosts the bridal shower, who pays for the bridal shower, and how to navigate tricky situations that may arise.", "\"Typically, the bridal shower is hosted by the mother of the bride, the maid of honor, or the matron of honor,\" Swann says. Alternatively, the wedding party may come together to host the bridal shower for their friend. There's also the possibility of another close family member or friend hosting the shower (think: a stepmom, an aunt or a mentor).", "There are several factors to take into consideration when selecting the host for the bridal shower, such as the couple's location, the location of the guests, and the location of the wedding party. If the to-be-wed is living far away from their hometown, perhaps it makes more sense for nearby friends to host the event. But if most of the guests live in the guest of honor's home, a hometown shower hosted by the family might make the most sense. You'll also want to consider what your friend wants for the event. Do they want a cozy home shower, a traditional high tea or a cocktail-style soir\u00e9e? If they've been dreaming out having their shower at a certain brunch place, you'll want to honor their wishes as best you can.", "If multiple people want to be involved in hosting, the maid of honor, matron of honor or man of honor should help coordinate so nobody feels left out. For example, if several people wish to host the event, they can co-host and take care of different aspects of the celebration (for instance, one person in charge of food, one person handling bridal shower games and one person managing the wedding shower decorations). Just be sure to mention everyone who's hosting on the shower invitations! Psst: you can purchase bridal shower invitations right here on The Knot.", "Once you've selected the host of the party, you have to decide who will pay for the bridal shower. Standard etiquette dictates the person hosting the shower would be the one who pays for it. However, if multiple people are hosting the shower (or if multiple people want to contribute to the event), that's absolutely fine too.", "\"In that situation, my recommendation for cutting back on conflict is to put one person in charge of collecting the money and then designating that person or another person to make the purchases,\" Swann says. \"That way, there's a very clear line of communication in terms of who is contributing what.\" Just be sure to clearly outline how much you're expecting from everyone involved so there's no confusion or hurt feelings down the line.", "While bridal showers don't have to be expensive affairs, food, rental space, d\u00e9cor and gifts can add up. If you've offered to contribute (or you're expected to as a member of the wedding party) and you're unable to swing the cost because of unexpected circumstances, Swann says it's best to be forthright and to communicate. \"Be honest, and be honest early,\" she says. \"Tell the host that circumstances have changed for you and that you're no longer able to participate in that way.\"", "However, Swann notes there are plenty of other ways you can contribute to the event, including sending out invitations, setting up the food or decorating the space.

A backyard tea party is a fun and inexpensive way to celebrate from the comfort of your own home. You can plan for affordable seating with the help of patio umbrellas and fresh linens. If you don\u2019t have a backyard, move the affair inside or ask a family friend if they\u2019d be willing to host the event. Planning the shower at a private residence is a great way to avoid paying for an actual venue. You\u2019ll also have the freedom to create an event that\u2019s as formal or informal as you want. Just make sure the shower matches the bride-to-be\u2019s personality.", "When thinking about your menu, we suggest avoiding a full sit-down meal if you want to throw a bridal shower on a budget. Entrees and side dishes can end up being quite pricey and then you\u2019ll have to think about place settings and flatware. Instead, opt for light appetizers or finger foods in order to cut costs. This also lets guests mingle with everyone, rather than sitting down for a formal meal. Serving a variety of easy-to-serve hors d\u2019oeuvres will keep the atmosphere light and fun while also allowing you to save some extra cash.", "Michelle Able Photography", "Any type of bridal shower venue can be transformed with the help of decor. However, don\u2019t feel the need to spend a huge sum of money on tablecloths, lighting, or other extravagant details. All you really need is some simple decor, such as balloons, bunting and some old photos of the bride-to-be to liven up the shower. Adding some family photos is a great way to personalize the party, and it\u2019s also a great conversation starter for guests who may not have known the bride during her baton-twirling days or awkward teen years.", "When choosing the entertainment, we suggest planning a time during the party to play some highly amusing \u2014 and affordable \u2014 bridal shower games! Bridal shower games are a fun and less expensive way to get everyone at the party to bond. These games are also easily played with the help of a few household items, such as toilet paper for the classic TP Couture Game or a few pads of paper for Bridal Pictionary. As for music, you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to hire a musician or an expensive sound system. Just create a bridal shower-inspired playlist on your phone or other device and connect it to speakers. Playing music will keep things from getting too quiet and help keep the atmosphere upbeat.", "Favors are a great way to thank guests for attending the shower, but this doesn\u2019t mean they have to be over the top.
