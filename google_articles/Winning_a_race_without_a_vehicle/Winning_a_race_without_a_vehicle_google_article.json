Some information in it may no longer be current.", "For the past five years, NASCAR has run a contest for celebrities and media where entrants predict how the Chase for the Cup will unfold over the 10-race playoff series that determines the season championship.", "The format is simple: Contestants pick where they think the 12 Chase drivers will place in the standings after each race. Unfortunately for those brave enough to attempt an entry, trying to figure out the possibilities without access to highly powerful cloud computing infrastructure is mind-boggling at best.", "NASCAR uses basic technology in its racing cars, such as carburetors, iron block engines and steel brakes, and it makes up for that lack of sophistication with its point system. Complicated doesn't even begin to describe it.", "Story continues below advertisement", "To start with, there's the ridiculous number of points handed out. A driver takes home 185 points for winning a race, although that automatically becomes 190 because NASCAR awards five bonus points for leading at least one lap, even under a caution period. Drivers also get a five-point bonus for leading the most laps, so a race winner can earn as much as 195 points.", "Things just get silly from there, especially when bonus points get added to the totals. For example, drivers regularly score as many, and in many cases more points than the guy one spot ahead in the classification due to bonuses. That simply makes no sense at all.", "In addition, every driver who starts an engine for a race scores points.", "When it comes to racing, pushing a button to fire up a motor should not be enough to deliver a minimum of 34 points. That seems to be a North American tendency also practiced in the IndyCar Series. But in racing, points should be difficult to score.", "In both NASCAR and IndyCar, a driver could presumably crash out of the season finale on the first lap, but yet still score enough points to win a championship. And for a series that continues to claim that it wants to put more emphasis on wins, NASCAR has a funny way of showing it.", "For example, in Formula One, the first place finisher gets 25 points and the last point scorer in 10th place gets one, or four per cent of the winner's tally. Before F1 changed its points system this year, the last scorer still got one, which was 10 per cent of the winner's total of 10.", "In NASCAR, it's 18 per cent, and that's a spread between first and 43rd (185 vs. 34). In the stock car series the 10th place finisher gets 134 points or roughly 28 per cent of the winner's haul.", "Story continues below advertisement", "The inflated points means a driver who wins one week and then has a rough outing the next loses ground to one who is more consistent. For example, a driver with a win and a 25th scores six fewer points (184 vs. 278) than one who takes two eighth place finishes. In F1, the difference would be 13 points in favour of the race winner, which in NASCAR terms is roughly 99 markers.", "The Chase for the Cup format adds to the argument that wins don't mean much in NASCAR. The 12 drivers who qualify to fight for the championship have their points reset to 5,000 and then 10 are added for each win. This is supposed to reward race winners, but judging from the first Chase race in Loudon N.H. on Sunday, it doesn't happen. Jimmie Johnson, five-time winner in the first 26 races, went from second to seventh in one race after a poor outing where he finished 25th, underlining that the points added per win to start the Chase are not significant enough.", "And rather than fix this complex system, there are rumblings that NASCAR will institute a knockout style Chase in 2011, with two drivers eliminated after every two races, and leaving just four in the end to fight for the title in the final two races. But that would not only add intricacy to a system that's already overly difficult for fans to follow without hiring a statistician.", "Instead, here's what NASCAR should do.", "First have only one-third of the field - 14 cars - score points, with the winner getting 40. Separate first from second by 10 points to give a winner a reward for taking the chequered flag, and then have second to fifth five points apart. The bottom two-thirds of the scorers would be separated by two points from fifth to 10th and then one point from 10th to 14th. Ditch the bonus for leading a lap, but give the driver who leads the most laps one point along with the pole sitter at each race.", "The good news is that the Chase format can remain the same under the new points system, since a reset at 5,000 plus 10 points per win would make victories mean much more and therefore adequately reward drivers for taking chequered flags in the first 26 races.", "Story continues below advertisement", "Under this scenario, Johnson would have still started the Chase with 5,050 points and despite not scoring anything in Loudon, he still would have remained second to Denny Hamlin who would have left New Hampshire with 5,090 points. And fans would easily be able to calculate that Johnson was a win behind. Bowyer would be fourth with 5,041 four points behind Kevin Harvick.", "Oh, how'd my first weekend in NASCAR pick the Chase positions game go?", "Got one out of 12 right for predicting Hamlin would stay first overall.", "Searching for a new vehicle?

Traditionally, races are run on oval tracks measuring approximately 0.25 to 2.66 miles (0.4 to 4.3 kilometers). The world's largest governing body for stock car racing is the American NASCAR, and its NASCAR Cup Series is the premier top-level series of professional stock car racing. Top-level races typically range between 200 to 600 miles (322 to 966\u00a0km) in length. The cars were originally production models (\"stock\") but are now highly modified.", "Top-level stock cars exceed 200\u00a0mph (322\u00a0km/h)[2][3][4] at speedway tracks and on superspeedway tracks such as Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.[5][6]\nContemporary NASCAR-spec top-level cars produce maximum power outputs of 860\u2013900\u00a0hp[7][8] from their naturally aspirated V8 engines. In October 2007 American race car driver Russ Wicks set a speed record for stock cars in a 2007-season Dodge Charger built to NASCAR specifications by achieving a maximum speed of 244.9\u00a0mph (394.1\u00a0km/h) at Bonneville Speedway.[9][10] For the 2015 NASCAR Cup Series, power output of the competing cars ranged from 750 to 800\u00a0hp (560 to 600\u00a0kW).[11][12]", "In the 1920s, moonshine runners during the Prohibition era would often have to outrun the authorities. To do so, they had to upgrade their vehicles\u2014while leaving them looking ordinary, so as not to attract attention.  Eventually, runners started getting together with fellow runners and making runs together. They would challenge one another and eventually progressed to organized events in the early 1930s. The main problem racing faced was the lack of a unified set of rules among the different tracks. When Bill France, Sr. saw this problem, he set up a meeting at the Streamline Hotel in order to form an organization that would unify the rules.[13]", "When NASCAR was first formed by France in 1948 to regulate stock car racing in the U.S, there was a requirement that any car entered be made entirely of parts available to the general public through automobile dealers.  Additionally, the cars had to be models that had sold more than 500 units to the public. This is referred to as \"homologation\". In NASCAR's early years, the cars were so \"stock\" that it was commonplace for the drivers to drive themselves to the competitions in the car that they were going to run in the race. While automobile engine technology had remained fairly stagnant in World War II, advanced aircraft piston engine development had provided a great deal of available data, and NASCAR was formed just as some of the improved technology was about to become available in production cars.[citation needed] Until the advent of the Trans-Am Series in 1967, NASCAR homologation cars were the closest thing that the public could buy that was actually very similar to the cars that were winning national races.[citation needed]", "The 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket V-8 with a displacement of 303\u00a0cu\u00a0in (5.0\u00a0L) is widely recognized as the first postwar modern overhead valve (OHV) engine to become available to the public.[14] The Oldsmobile was an immediate success in 1949 and 1950, and all the automobile manufacturers could not help noticing the higher sales of the Oldsmobile 88 to the buying public.[citation needed] The motto of the day became \"win on Sunday, sell on Monday\". However, in spite of the fact that several competing engines were more advanced, the aerodynamic and low-slung Hudson Hornet managed to win in 1951, 1952, and 1953 with a 308\u00a0cu\u00a0in (5.0\u00a0L) inline six-cylinder that used an old-style flathead engine, proving there was more to winning than just a more powerful engine.[citation needed]", "At the time, it typically took three years for a new design of car body or engine to end up in production and be available for NASCAR racing.[citation needed] Most cars sold to the public did not have a wide variety of engine choices, and the majority of the buying public at the time was not interested in the large displacement special edition engine options that would soon become popular. However, the end of the Korean War in 1953 started an economic boom, and then car buyers immediately began demanding more powerful engines.[citation needed]", "Also in 1953, NASCAR recommended that the drivers add roll bars, but did not require them.[15]", "In 1955, Chrysler produced the C-300 with its Chrysler FirePower engine 300\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) 303\u00a0cu\u00a0in (5.0\u00a0L) OHV engine, which easily won in 1955 and 1956.[citation needed]", "In 1957, several notable events happened. The Automobile Manufacturers Association (AMA) banned manufacturers from using race wins in their advertising and giving direct support to race teams,[16] as they felt it led to reckless street racing. This forced manufacturers to become creative in producing race parts to help racers win. Race teams were often caught trying to use factory produced racing parts that were not really available to the public, though many parts passed muster by being labeled as heavy-duty \"police\" parts. Car manufacturers wanted to appear compliant with the ban, but they also wanted to win.[citation needed]", "The NASCAR tracks at the time were mainly dirt tracks with modest barriers, and during the 1957 season a Mercury Monterey crashed into the crowd. This killed many spectators, and resulted in a serious overhaul of the safety rules, which in turn prompted the building of larger, more modern tracks.[citation needed] Also in 1957, Chevrolet sold enough of their new fuel injected engines to the public in order to make them available for racing (and Ford began selling superchargers as an option), but Bill France immediately banned fuel injection and superchargers from NASCAR before they could race. However, even without official factory support or the use of fuel injection, Buck Baker won in 1957 driving a small-block V-8 Chevrolet Bel Air.[citation needed]", "In 1961, Ford introduced the F1 390 in a low drag Galaxie \"Starliner\", but 1960 and '61 championships were won by drivers in 409-powered Chevrolet Impalas.[citation needed]", "Pontiac introduced their \"Super Duty\" 421 in Catalinas that made use of many aluminum body parts to save weight, and the Pontiacs easily won in 1962.[citation needed]", "The desire from fans and manufacturers alike for higher performance cars within the restrictions of homologation meant that carmakers began producing limited production \"special edition\" cars based on high production base models. It also became apparent that manufacturers were willing to produce increasingly larger engines to remain competitive (Ford had developed a 483 they hoped to race). For the 1963 season NASCAR engines were restricted to using a maximum displacement of 7.0 liters (427 cu.in.) and using only two valves per cylinder.", "Also, even with heavy duty special editions sold to the public for homologation purposes, the race car rules were further modified, primarily in the interest of safety. This is because race drivers and their cars during this era were subjected to forces unheard of in street use, and require a far higher level of protection than is normally afforded by truly \"stock\" automobile bodies.", "In 1963 Ford sold enough of their aerodynamic \"sport-roof\" edition Galaxies to the public so it would qualify as stock, and with the heavy-duty FE block bored and stroked to the new limit of 427, the top five finishers were all Fords. Chrysler had bored their 413 to create the \"Max Wedge\" 426, but it still could not compete with the Fords. General Motors' headquarters had genuinely tried to adhere to the 1957 ban, but their Chevrolet division had also constantly tried to work around it, because the other manufacturers had openly circumvented the ban. In 1963 GM gave in and openly abandoned compliance, and Chevrolet was allowed to produce the ZO6 427, but it did not immediately enjoy success.", "Then, in 1964 the new Chrysler 426 Hemi engine so dominated the series[citation needed] in a Plymouth Belvedere \"Sport Fury\", the homologation rules were changed so that 1,000 of any engine and car had to be sold to the public to qualify as a stock part, instead of just 500. This made the 426 Hemi unavailable for the 1965 season.", "In 1965 Ford adapted two single-overhead-cams to their FE 427 V8 to allow it to run at a higher RPM (called the Ford 427 Cammer). Ford started to sell \"cammers\" to the public to homologate it (mostly to dealer-sponsored privateer drag racers), but NASCAR changed the rules to specify that all NASCAR engines must use a single cam-in-block. But even without the cammer, the Ford FE 427 won in 1965.", "In 1966 Chrysler sold enough of the 426 Hemis to make it available again, and they put it in their new Dodge Charger which had a low-drag rear window that was radically sloped. It was called a \"fast-back\", and because of this David Pearson was the series champion that year with Richard Petty dominating 1967, winning 27 of 48 races (including 10 in a row) in the boxier Plymouth Belvedere.", "The 1969 season featured the Torino Cobra or Torino \"Talladega\" which had enough aerodynamic body improvements that it gave it a higher speed than the 1968 Torino, with no other changes. The Cobra, featuring extended nose and reshaped rockers, was renamed Talladega part way through the 1969 season when the Boss 429 replaced the 427. Starting in 1963 up till this point, Ford had won six straight Manufacturer Championships, and by the end of the 1969 season Ford would make it seven in a row. Richard Petty was tired of winning races but losing the championship, so after a private viewing of Ford's new Talladega and Boss 429 engine, he signed a lucrative deal with Ford.", "Prior to its first race at the Daytona 500, David Pearson's 427 powered Ford Torino Cobra set a new NASCAR record by being the first to exceed 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h) when he qualified at 190.029\u00a0mph (305.822\u00a0km/h). When the race started Donnie Allison's Torino lead the majority of the race (84 laps). Towards the end of the race the Torino of LeeRoy Yarbrough chased down the Dodge of Charlie Glotzbach, who had an 11-second lead.  It was the first Daytona 500 won on a last lap pass. Things got worse for Dodge when NASCAR, a few months later, finally allowed Ford to run its hemi-headed Boss 429 engine.", "With Ford winning the majority of the races, Dodge was forced to develop a better car of their own. Using the Charger 500 as a basis, they added a pointed nose. This nose was almost a carbon copy of the nose on the 1962 Ford Mustang I prototype. This radical body shape required a wing to remain stable at speeds over 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h). They named it the Dodge Daytona after the race they hoped to win. Even though it never won a Daytona 500 race, it was still a significant improvement over its predecessor the Dodge Charger 500.", "NASCAR feared that these increasing speeds significantly surpassed the abilities of the tire technology of the day, and it would undoubtedly increase the number of gruesome wrecks that were occurring. As a result, the 1970 Homologation rules were changed so that one car for every two U.S. dealers had to be built for sale to the public to qualify, hoping to delay the use of aero-bodies until tires could improve.", "For the 1970 season Dodge raced the 1969 model Daytona, but Plymouth managed to build over 1,920 Plymouth Superbirds, which were similarly equipped to the Daytona. Petty came back to Plymouth in the plus 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h) Superbird, and Bobby Isaac won the season championship in a Daytona. NASCAR restricted all \"aero-cars\" including the Ford Talladega, Mercury Spoiler II, Charger 500, Dodge Daytona and Plymouth Superbird to a maximum engine displacement of 305\u00a0cu\u00a0in (5.0\u00a0L) for 1971. Almost all teams switched to non-aero bodystyles.  NASCAR eventually adopted a restrictor plate to limit top speeds for the 7.0L engine as teams switched to small-block 358\u00a0cu\u00a0in (5.9\u00a0L) engines.", "Fans, drivers, and manufacturers alike demanded a complete revamping of the rules.[citation needed] NASCAR responded in a way that they hoped would make the cars safer and more equal, so the race series would be more a test of the drivers, rather than a test of car technology.", "The era drew to a conclusion in the 1970s.  1972 brought so many rule changes, it has prompted many to consider this year as the start of the modern era of NASCAR racing.[citation needed] In addition, R.J. Reynolds (the tobacco conglomerate) took over as the major sponsor of NASCAR racing (changing the name to the \"Winston Cup\") and they made a significantly larger financial contribution than previous sponsors. Richard Petty's personal sponsorship with STP also set new, higher standards for financial rewards to driving teams. The sudden infusion of noticeably larger amounts of money changed the entire nature of the sport.", "The 1973 oil crisis meant that large displacement special edition homologation cars of all makes were suddenly sitting unsold. Through the balance of the 1970s until 1992, the factory stock sheetmetal over a racing frame meant the cars looked very much like their street version counterparts.  It can be said that 1993, with the addition of ground effect wrap-around type spoilers marked the beginning non-stock sheetmetal and from that point forward, stock cars were quickly allowed to differ greatly from anything available to the public. Modern racing \"stock\" cars are stock in name only, using a body template that is vaguely modeled after currently available automobiles. The chassis, running gear, and other equipment have almost nothing to do with anything in ordinary automobiles.  NASCAR and the auto manufacturers have become aware of this, and for 2013 each brand (Chevrolet, Dodge, Ford, and Toyota) have redesigned their racing sheetmetal to more resemble the street models of their cars.", "A stock car, in the original sense of the term, is an automobile that has not been modified from its original factory configuration. Later the term stock car came to mean any production-based automobile used in racing.  This term is used to differentiate such a car from a \"race car\", a special, custom-built car designed only for racing purposes.", "The degree to which the cars conform to standard model specs has changed over the years and varies from country to country. Today most American stock cars may superficially resemble standard American family sedans, but are in fact purpose-built racing machines built to a strict set of regulations governing the car design ensuring that the chassis, suspension, engine, etc. are architecturally identical on all vehicles. For example, NASCAR Cup Series race vehicles now require fuel injection.\nThe closest European equivalent to stock car racing is probably touring car racing. In the UK and New Zealand there is a racing formula called stock cars but the cars are markedly different from any road car.\nIn Australia there was a formula that was quite similar to NASCAR called AUSCAR.", "The Racecar-Euro Series began in 2009 and was sanctioned by NASCAR as a touring series in 2012, currently operating as the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series.", "\"True\" stock car racing, which consists of only street vehicles that can be bought by the general public, is sometimes now called \"street stock\", \"pure stock\", \"hobby stock\", \"showroom stock\", or \"U-car\" racing. In 1972, SCCA started its first showroom stock racing series, with a price ceiling on the cars of $3,000. Some modern showroom stock racing allows safety modifications done on showroom stock cars.", "Super stock classes are similar to street stock, but allow for more modifications to the engine.  Power output is usually in the range of 500\u2013550 horsepower (373\u2013410 kilowatts).  Tire width is usually limited to 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm).[17]", "Some entry level classes are called \"street stock\", and are similar to what is often called \"banger racing\" in England.", "Late models are usually the highest class of stock cars in local racing.[17]  Rules for construction of a late model car vary from region to region and even race track to race track. The most common variations (on paved tracks) include super late models (SLMs), late model stock cars (LMSCs), and limited late models (LLMs). A late model may be a custom built machine, or a heavily modified street car. Individual sanctioning bodies (like NASCAR, ACT, PASS, UARA, CRA, etc.) maintain their own late model rule books, and even individual racetracks can maintain their own rule books, meaning a late model that is legal in one series or at one track may not be legal at another without modifications. The national touring series, the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Division, originated from local late model races in the east coast of the U.S. This division was later called the \"Busch Series\", the \"Nationwide Series\", and currently the \"Xfinity Series\" as its title sponsor changed.", "NASCAR is currently the largest stock car racing governing body in the world. While NASCAR sanctions multiple series, it has three national championship touring series that are commonly referred to as the \"top 3\" series. In addition to the top three series, NASCAR also sanctions many regional and local series. NASCAR also sanctions three international series that race in Canada, Mexico, and Europe.", "The most prominent championship in stock car racing is the NASCAR Cup Series. It is the most popular racing series in the United States, drawing over 6\u00a0million spectators in 1997, an average live audience of over 190,000 people for each race.", "The most famous event in the series is the Daytona 500,[18] an annual 500-mile (800\u00a0km) race at the Daytona International Speedway. The series' second-biggest event is arguably The Brickyard 400, an annual 400-mile (640\u00a0km) race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the legendary home of the Indianapolis 500, an open-wheeled race. However, the event was excluded from the 2021 schedule in favor of a race on the track's road course.[19] Together the Cup Series and Xfinity Series drew 8\u00a0million spectators in 1997, compared to 4\u00a0million for both American open-wheel series (CART and IRL), which merged in 2008 under the IRL banner. In 2002, 17 of the 20 US top sporting events in terms of attendance were stock car races. Only football drew more television viewers that year.", "The NASCAR Xfinity Series is the second tier series in the United States. It serves as the primary feeder series to the Cup Series, similar to Formula Two for Formula One, and Indy Lights for Indy Car. Races are commonly held as a support race to Cup Series events. Many current Cup Series drivers formerly competed in the Series before moving on to competing full-time in the Cup Series.", "The Xfinity series typically features multiple Cup Series competitors competing alongside full time Xfinity drivers. There was some controversy as Cup Series drivers tended to be more successful than full-time Xfinity drivers. Cup drivers aren't eligible to score points in the Xfinity series, and are limited to the amount of races they are allowed to race in the Series.", "Starting in 1995, the NASCAR Truck Series is the third highest ranking stock car series in the United States. The series was the brainchild of then-NASCAR West Coast executive Ken Clapp, who was inspired by off-road truck racing.[20] Unlike the other two national touring NASCAR series, the Truck Series race pickup truck styled bodies, though it is still considered a stock car series because of its similarity. Much like the Xfinity Series, the Truck Series often features Cup Series drivers competing for parts of the season.", "Outside of NASCAR, there are a number of other national or regional stock-car sanctioning bodies in the United States.  There are a few organizations that cater to these local short tracks.  The Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA), American Speed Association (ASA), Champion Racing Association (CRA), International Motor Contest Association (IMCA), United Auto Racing Association (UARA), and Championship Auto Racing Series (CARS) all sanction their own forms of stock-car racing, on varying types of track, and with various levels of media coverage.  The International Race of Champions (IROC) series used stock cars, but is usually perceived as being outside of the usual stock car racing scene because of its 'All-Star' design.", "Stockcar racing began in New Zealand during the 1950s, first race was at Aranui Speedway on November 27, 1954. It was brought to New Zealand after New Zealand Speedway riders witnessed the huge crowds that watched the races in Britain earlier that year. As with the UK, Stockcar racing in New Zealand is a very different form of racing than that of the USA.  Stockcar racing is a full contact sport in New Zealand: as the rule book states, \"contact is not only permitted, it is encouraged\".[citation needed]\nCars are built to an extremely rigid design and feature strong steel guards around almost the entire car. \"Stockcars\" are divided into three classes: Superstocks, Stockcars, Ministocks (Ministocks predominantly being a non-contact youth class).\nSuperstocks are the top class and are typically powered by V8 engines up to 4.1 litres (248\u00a0cu\u00a0in) which can produce over 370 kilowatts (500\u00a0hp).  The majority of races are of an individual nature however, unique to New Zealand stockcar racing is the team racing format.  Typically teams racing consists of two teams of four cars each that work together to win the race. Teams normally protect their \"runners\" while attempting to eliminate the opposing team, the races can be decided by a points format or first across the finish line.", "The class most resembling the North American form of stockcar racing are known as Saloon cars. Super Saloons are similar to dirt late models with the main differences being the bodies closer resemble production cars, use iron engines up to 7.1 litres (434\u00a0cu\u00a0in) with no rear offset and run much larger sprintcar tyres on the rear.", "Stock car racing in the NASCAR mould (AUSCAR) had a following in Australia during the mid-late 1980s and through the 1990s, but with the advent of the Supercars Championship, which took up the bulk of the competitors, sponsorship dollars on offer as well as major television time, the Australian Superspeedway series shut down after 2001.", "The majority of the NASCAR and AUSCAR racing in Australia took place at the 1.801\u00a0km (1.119\u00a0mi), high-banked (24\u00b0) Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne. The Thunderdome, which was opened in 1987 and was built by multi-millionaire tyre retailer Bob Jane at a cost of A$54 million, was modelled on a scaled down version of the famous Charlotte Motor Speedway. Other tracks used included the \u200b1\u20442 mile (805 metre) Speedway Super Bowl at the Adelaide International Raceway (also owned by Jane, this was the only paved oval track in Australia other than the Thunderdome, though with only 7\u00b0 banking in the turns it was more of a traditional flat track), as well as road courses such as the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit (where the cars ran as a support category to the Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix), Oran Park in Sydney, and the famous Mount Panorama Circuit.", "Stock, in the sense of cars appearing to be similar to conventional road vehicles, is represented in the UK (and Europe) by touring cars.[citation needed]", "The term 'stock cars' in the UK refers to a specialised form of racing that bears little resemblance to any road car.", "Stock car racing was brought to Britain in 1954. Taking place on existing greyhound or speedway tracks, the cars were mostly 'stock' cars from the 1930s with locked rear axle differentials and added armour. After the first couple of years 'specials' began to appear eventually making the 'stock' car name something of a misnomer. Since the early days of stock car racing in Britain the sport has developed into many different classes, from the destructive 'Banger' categories to the very sophisticated National Hot Rods. However, the name 'stock car' is usually reserved for that racing class which traces its roots back to these early days in the 1950s, BriSCA F1 Stock Cars, which were previously known as \"The Seniors\" or \"Senior Stock Cars\".  Despite the physical demands of this full-contact sport, many competitors have been racing for 20 and even 30 years.  For the first 10 years of the sport, stock cars were either adapted from road cars, or bore the recognizable bodywork of road cars. By the 1970s, chassis and bodywork had evolved into very specialized forms.", "The modern BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars are a highly sophisticated purpose built race car with race-tuned V-8 engines developing 480\u00a0kW (650\u00a0bhp), quick change axles and gearboxes and biased and staggered chassis and braking set up for constant left turning. However large bumpers were mandatory with contact very much encouraged to remove opponents. The sport can be seen at venues throughout Britain and Mainland Europe. A downsized version of the BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars, the smaller BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars, previously known as \"The Juniors\" or \"Junior Stock Cars\", are also very popular. these cars are powered by the 2 litre Ford 'Pinto' engine.

However, it was in controversial circumstances after first across the line Gordon Moodie (Thomson Jr's brother-in-law) was disqualified from the race after being found with carburetor irregularities at post race scrutineering. This irregularity has since been proven to be a manufacturing fault with the control of the driver but the governing body have refused to reinstate Gordon Moodie as the winner in the record books. In 2009 the World Championship winner was Micky Brennan and in 2010 the World Championship winner was John Fortune. The 2011 World Championship Final took place at Kings Lynns Norfolk Arena on Saturday 17 September with 871 Mark Simpson winner of the Gold Roof.

The highest local division, asphalt late model racing, is generally considered a requirement to advance to the next step, regional and national touring series.", "Dirt track drivers follow the same general path. Their highest divisions are less well-known national touring late model series such as the World of Outlaws Late Model Series and regional touring series.", "Some drivers have entered stock car racing after starting on a very different career path.  The most famous might well be Mario Andretti, who is the only driver ever to win the Indianapolis 500 (1969), NASCAR's Daytona 500 (1967), and the Formula One World Championship (1978). Juan Pablo Montoya is the only other driver with wins in all three series, with two Indy 500 wins (2000 and 2015), seven Formula One wins and two Sprint Cup wins (2007 and 2010). A. J. Foyt, with four Indianapolis 500 wins, seven IndyCar championships, and a victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans on his resume, also won the Daytona 500 in 1972. Johnny Rutherford, a three-time winner at Indy, has the rare distinction of winning his first NASCAR start, a qualifying race for the 1963 Daytona 500. Dan Gurney, a leading 1960s Formula One driver and later one of the most successful constructors of Indy cars (as well as being Foyt's co-driver at Le Mans), excelled in NASCAR's road-course events, winning at Riverside five times between 1963 and 1968.  A notable crossover oddity is the one-race NASCAR career of the colorful Formula One and sports car driver Innes Ireland: after retiring at the end of the 1966 season, he was invited by NASCAR czar Bill France to compete at Daytona, where he was running in the top ten when his engine blew on the 126th of 200 laps.", "Montoya initially surprised the auto racing community by leaving F1, but he was quickly followed by other drivers.

Two-time Australian Supercars champion Marcos Ambrose competed in the Monster Energy Cup Series from 2007 to 2014, winning two races.", "Other drivers compete often in stock car racing but are well known for their success elsewhere. Ron Fellows and Boris Said are champion road racers and are often brought in by teams solely to compete in NASCAR's road course events, a title known as road course ringers. Robby Gordon was one of NASCAR's few remaining owner-drivers, but he is most famous for his numerous off-road championships and his three Baja 1000 wins.", "Stock car races take place predominantly on oval tracks of 3 or 4 turns, with all turns to the left. Oval tracks are classified as short track (less than 1 mile), intermediate or speedway (1 to 2 miles) or superspeedway (over 2 miles). Road courses are any tracks having both left and right turns. Depending on the track, typical race speeds can vary from 90 miles per hour (140\u00a0km/h) at Martinsville to over 200 miles per hour (320\u00a0km/h) at Talladega. In 1987 Bill Elliott's 212.809\u00a0mph (342.483\u00a0km/h) qualifying time at Talladega brought about a change at superspeedways (Daytona and Talladega). Such high speeds and Bobby Allison's car going airborne into the catch-fence and injuring fans forced NASCAR to implement power-reducing measures, one of which was the mandated implement of below carburetor restrictor plates. This later became known as restrictor plate racing.", "Oval circuits differ from the rough terrain and sharp turns of Rally, and the complicated twists and turns of Formula One tracks that put up to 5 or 6\u00a0g of horizontal stress on the driver's body. Stock cars are much heavier than Formula One cars, and as a result they are generally slower. Additionally, they cannot produce the g-forces of an open wheel car. A stock car's weak handling with high power output places more emphasis on car control.[citation needed]", "In contrast with most forms of racing, minor car-to-car contact is generally accepted in stock car racing.  This may happen in the form of forcing another vehicle out of the way, or pushing a competing vehicle forward for mutual benefit. Stock cars are generally built to be tolerant of superficial damage to bodywork, whereas open wheel designs can experience severe issues with even slight spoiler damage. On intermediate tracks and superspeedways, drafting is used to reduce the overall effect of drag.

After rattling off half a dozen or so past successes \u2013 from the GTR series to their Need for Speed: Shift titles \u2013  Andy Tudor, the Brit-based game maker's creative director, calls their forthcoming World of Speed \"completely different from what we've done before.\"", "More than that though, Tudor believes they're tackling the genre in a way no other developer has. \"We want to provide something players really haven't seen before. We're laser-focused on three things \u2013 arcade-y action, MMO elements, and team-a play. We don't really feel like MMOs have been done with racing, certainly not team-based racing.\"", "While Tudor cites Burnout and MotorStorm as inspirations for World of Speed's accessible, action-amping handling, he actually credits non-racing titles with helping his team construct those latter two pillars. \"We always look at different genres\u2026we don't want racing to get stale. When you play World of Speed we want you to get the idea that it's different; it's the fact that you can come in seventh, but who cares since your team still won and you contributed to that by completing mandatory objectives we put in there.\" It's these objectives \u2013 not unlike those set in popular team-based multiplayer shooters \u2013 that most separates World of Speed from the tire-screeching pack.", "Doing a 180 on what the genre's always burned into racing fans' brains, Tudor elaborates on how crossing the finish line first isn't necessarily the best way to win the cup. \"You see, the red team might place in positions 1,2,3 and 4, but if the blue team completes all their objectives \u2013 maybe drift or draft for 1000 meters, beat a lap time, or take all the shortcuts during a particular race \u2013 then that contributes to the final score and they could end up actually winning. The objectives are one of the biggest things to takeaway.\"", "The hope, according to Tudor, is that this objective-based play will feed World of Speed's MMO side. Similar to building a class-specific character in World of Warcraft, players can customize and progress their drivers with certain skills in mind. An expert drifter, for example, needn't have his eye on the checkered flag, but like a medic in a more traditional multi-player experience, he'll play an integral supporting role in seeing his team to ultimate victory. Selecting this particular path could also see a dedicated player accumulating drift-specific abilities, perks and skills, as well as a garage full of cars tweaked to complement them.", "Getting individual players to adopt and excel in these class-like specializations is just the first step, though. In theory, the real fun \u2013 and MMO-flavored social structure \u2013 will come from formed clubs that pick members based on their particular pedal-to-the-medal skills. Despite the game's focus on pick-up-and-play action, Tudor would like to see it embraced by a dedicated fan-base willing to dig beyond its surface appeal to discover its depth; ideally, for every solo speedster that hops in for a quick adrenaline jolt, they'll be more invested players that seek each other out, form clubs, talk strategy, and enter each race as they would an MMO raid.", "A mode dubbed \"Territory Wars\" will support these clubs, allowing them to compete for domination of particular tracks. Tudor, who sees this mode as an evolution of Need for Speed's competition-fueling Autolog feature, calls this a \"massive opportunity for bragging rights; a way to really put your stamp on the game.\" In addition to unlocking a track's clubhouse \u2013 and all the benefits that come with it \u2013 owning an area of the game also means having your club's personalized logo displayed for all comers to see. Of course, garishly waving your team colors will also entice other clubs to replace your adornments with their own stripes; dominating a track is one thing, but defending your club's squatter's rights is what Tudor hopes will feed the desire to actually assemble clubs worthy of competition.", "Driven by its objective-based play, the incentive to build diversified clubs definitely differentiates World of Speed from its speed limit-breaking brethren. Beyond these defining features though, it's aiming to be a seat-of-the-pants racer anyone can jump into. Accessible, action-oriented handling and real-world locales complement what Tudor calls a \"console-quality experience.\" At launch it will support 8 players (4v4) and include 50 cars unleashed on the streets and professional tracks of London, Moscow, and Monaco.", "While my time behind the wheel was brief, I enjoyed a few pulse-spiking thrills tearing up the blacktop in London and tooling around Brands Hatch, a pro course outside the city. The visual presentation doesn't quite match the near-photorealism of next-gen racers like Forza 5, but the cars are appealingly shiny and reflective, while environments are packed with more detail than my eyes can absorb at 100 mph.

We\u2019ve collated the most successful below, with our criteria being simply that they\u2019ve won more than one title. That leaves us with nine teams boasting 56 titles between them. But who tops the pile?", "Title years: 1961, 1964, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008", "Perhaps it isn\u2019t in any way surprising that Ferrari tops this list. It has started more Grands Prix than any other constructor \u2013 by more than 100. It also started racing in Formula 1 eight years before any other team on this list, and 16 years before any other team still competing with them. It\u2019s also won more races than any other, had more 1-2 finishes, more podiums, more pole positions, more fastest laps and won more points than any other team in Formula 1 history. It took Ferrari four seasons to win its first constructors title after the crown was invented in 1958. That first title was secured in 1961 by the American-German duo of Phil Hill and Wolfgang von Trips, securing the title, and with it a Drivers\u2019 crown for Hill, without racing at the final race in the US (after von Trips tragically lost his life at the penultimate round in Italy). Since then Ferrari\u2019s championship victories have come in sprees. It clinched crowns through the \u201870s with the likes of Niki Lauda, Jody Scheckter and Gilles Villeneuve, then a couple more in the early-\u201880s with Villeneuve (without clinching a drivers\u2019 crown this time). But it would then be nearly two decades before Ferrari held aloft the trophy again. It took the force of nature that was the Ross Brawn-Jean Todt-Michael Schumacher trio to restore Ferrari to glory. At which point they went ahead and won almost everything in sight, winning seven titles in the 2010s. Since then it\u2019s been another dry spell for the Prancing Horse, with the new forces of Mercedes and Red Bull coming to control the \u201810s.", "Title years: 1980, 1981, 1986, 1987, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997", "It is Williams entry to this list that might be the most amazing streak of all. The team from Grove in Oxfordshire only entered its first race as a constructor in 1977, had won its first title by 1980 and won eight more over the next seventeen years. The period of dominance also saw titles for Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet, Keke Rosberg, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve. Behind the scenes Williams has also been filled with famous names. The pen of Patrick Head helped to spawn most of the early winners, and he was followed by Adrian Newey, a man whose name has become synonymous with building incredibly rapid racing cars. But after Newey left, and Villeneuve helped win the \u201997 crown, Williams checked out. It is still racing today but, aside from a period of competitiveness with BMW in the early-\u201800s, Williams has never been a true contender since. But Frank Williams\u2019s incredibly-British team continues to be a fan favourite no matter what. It\u2019s perhaps because of the Williams dominance coinciding with the rise of really televised Formula 1 around the globe, or just because of the fiercely independent nature of the team that Williams continues to grab the attention despite being stuck right at the very back of the field.", "Title years: 1974, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1998", "Here you will find perhaps the biggest disparity between winning constructors titles, and winning drivers titles. McLaren actually sit second on the all-time list of drivers\u2019 titles, with 12, only three shy of Ferrari\u2019s total of 15. But the ethos of McLaren appears to have always been geared toward that top-line individual championship glory. While it has won the drivers\u2019 title while missing out on constructors glory four times, McLaren has never won the constructors title without the help of a drivers\u2019 champion, unlike Ferrari, for whom that become a regular feat in the 1970s and 1980s. McLaren\u2019s dominance really came through the late-1980s and early-1990s. In that period, with Gordon Murray involved and Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna leading the charge, McLaren won six titles in eight years, including four on the trot. They resumed their place at the front of the field in 1998, clinching the title as well as the drivers\u2019 crown for Mika H\u00e4kkinen. But since then McLaren hasn\u2019t won a constructors crown, and has in fact won only one since 1991. In that time McLaren has won the 2008 drivers\u2019 title with Lewis Hamilton and a second title for Mika Hakkinen in 1999, but for both of those it was beaten to teams\u2019 victory by Ferrari.

The genius of Colin Chapman helped Lotus become the team to beat in the 1960s and early-1970s, much to the chagrin of Enzo Ferrari. Powered by Ford and Cosworth\u2019s mighty DFV the lightweight Lotus brand would become the masters of the aerodynamic arts with the mighty Lotus 72, before transforming Formula 1 with the invention of ground effect. From then Lotus continued to innovate and introduce some incredible names to Formula 1, but never managed to climb to the top of the tree. Its last title for both drivers and constructors came in 1978 with Mario Andretti, and then other than some wins that was that for Lotus. Sure it would launch names like Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna onto the F1 map, but there would be no more titles. Lotus folded in the early 1990s. Two more teams have taken the Lotus name since, with one even receiving some backing from the car firm, which still remains a going concern, but neither was really worthy of the name.", "Title years: 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019", "There is a legitimate argument to be made that both Brawn and Tyrrell\u2019s single constructor crowns could be included into this legacy. But officially the Mercedes team has just the six F1 titles to its name. There are two reasons for this, firstly Merc\u2019s first dominant period in F1 came before the invention of the world title. In the 1950s the great Juan Manuel Fangio won two titles driving Mercs, but there was no constructors crown to win then. Secondly after the 1955 Le Mans disaster Mercedes decided to quit motorsport, and the name wouldn\u2019t return to F1 as a constructor until 2010. When they did come back though, having purchased the Brawn team that used to be Honda, that used to be BAR, that used to be Tyrrell, they did it hard. A few fallow years at the start were merely marking time while the ruleset changed and hybridisation arrived. When it did, there was no stopping them. Since the debut of the V6-hybrid engines in 2014 Mercedes has only failed to win 32 races... out of 121. It has clinched the constructors title every season, and Lewis Hamilton has won five of the available drivers\u2019 crowns \u2013 with the other going to team-mate Nico Rosberg. Whether that will become a seventh consecutive crown when the 2020 season finally gets going feels like an almost forgone conclusion.", "Title years: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013", "Red Bull is another team that can trace its ancestry back through a few other teams, but in this case not quite to the level that Merc can (with Tyrrell having history way back into the early days of F1). Red Bull arrived into Formula 1 in 2005, buying the Jaguar team from a desperate-to-sell Ford (Jaguar had previously been the heavily Ford-backed Stewart). When Red Bull arrived it meant business, and hired the aforementioned Newey in 2005. He produced a series of striking, but ultimately uninspiring, cars until, as with so many changes in teams\u2019 fortunes, came a major rules reset. In 2009 the absolute glut of aerodynamic tech that had begun to festoon the cars was largely dismissed, leaving little wiggle room for the designers. The conditions were perfect for a team with a genius like Newey at the helm, a man who could find the sort of marginal gains that the newly restrictive rules meant you had to look for. Teamed up with a young and fired-up Sebastian Vettel it won four titles on the bounce, setting the kinds of records we thought we\u2019d never see again (then Mercedes stepped up). Indeed in 2011 the two Red Bull cars started on pole in 18 of 19 races \u2013 they would win only 12 of those races.", "Title years: 1959, 1960", "Many of these teams have won a series of titles by taking a change to Formula 1\u2019s rulebook and finding the sweet spot. Cooper on the other hand just built something no-one had seen before. In 1959 no world champion drivers were on the grid (following the death of Mike Hawthorn and the retirement of Juan Manuel Fangio. Vanwall, which won the first F1 constructors title in 1958, also withdrew, leaving Ferrari as the only remaining race-winning team on the grid. But there were still some big names lining up. Ferrari were joined by Porsche, Lotus, Maserati and Aston Martin. But they were all beaten by a small team from Surbiton, which brought along a complete revolution in the way Formula 1 cars were built. Cooper had effectively reversed the F1 car, sticking the engine behind the driver rather than the other way round. With its revolutionary new cars Cooper won five races, driven by Jack Brabham, Stirling Moss and Bruce McLaren. Brabham would also win the drivers\u2019 crown. The following year both Brabham and Cooper would do it again. Cooper won seven of the ten F1 races that season. At the Indy 500 Cooper turned up with a car that was widely mocked on arrival, but started the same rear-engined revolution as it had in F1. Founder Charles Cooper died in 1964 and son John Cooper sold the company in 1965. The company would win one race in 1966 with John Surtees and another in 1967 with Pedro Rodriguez, before bowing out after a single race in 1969.", "Title years: 1966, 1967", "We\u2019ve met \u2018Black\u2019 Jack Brabham with Cooper, winning two titles in those magic little rear-engined machines. Well, when he\u2019d done with that he went off and founded his own team. With that team he went on to win another drivers\u2019 title (his third) in 1966, with his team also taking a debut constructors crown. The following season he was joined by Denny Hulme at the wheel of the Repco-engined Brabhams. Hulme promptly won his first, and only F1 title and Brabham won their second constructors crown. It would not win another. Following a few years in the wilderness Brabham would go on to win two more drivers\u2019 titles in the 1980s, after future F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone had bought the team and brought in design guru Gordon Murray and Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet. But it failed to add the constructors title both times. Ecclestone eventually lost interest in the team and sold it on, after which Brabham dropped sharply to the back of the grid. It\u2019s only real notable achievement after 1985 being launching the F1 Career of Damon Hill.", "Title years: 2005, 2006", "Another team for which you could potentially claim more titles, the current Renault team is the former Lotus, which is the former Renault, Bennetton and Toleman teams. Renault has had several cracks at F1, first back in the 1970s and \u201880s, then again in this title winning period in the 2000s, before returning (buying back the same team) for its current foray into Formula 1. So far only one of those forays has born championship fruit. With the mix of Fernando Alonso\u2019s driving skill, Pat Symonds design skill and the force of nature that is Flavio Briatore at the helm the 2005 and 2006 titles were clinched, breaking the Schumacher/Ferrari hold on Formula 1 \u2013 and becoming the first team to win the title with a car not designed by Adrian Newey or Rory Byrne since 1991. Since then things haven\u2019t been so kind to the part-government owned Renault brand in F1.

But his career \u2013 and life \u2013 went off the rails before he could make an impactSteve Dalkowski, a career minor-leaguer who very well could have been the fastest (and wildest) pitcher in baseball history, died in April at the age of 80 from complications from Covid-19. And yet, partly because of one missing detail, his legend lives on, perhaps for ever.    A book and a documentary \u2013 both of which were in the works well before Dalkowski\u2019s death \u2013 have been released since Dalkowski, who had alcohol-related dementia, died in his home town, New Britain, Connecticut, where he became a phenomenon more than 60 years ago.Both the book, Dalko: The Untold Story of Baseball\u2019s Fastest Pitcher, and the documentary, Far From Home: The Steve Dalkowski Story, carefully attempt to clarify, and even dispel, many of the myths that have surfaced about Dalkowski over the years.    Nowadays, everything in sports is quantified down to each pitch, or play, and plenty of video exists. It was not always that way. Tom Chiappetta, the Connecticut native who took 30 years to assemble the documentary, has been unable to uncover film of Dalkowski pitching in a game.    \u201cThis is the last time we\u2019re going to have an American sports legend to talk about,\u201d Brian Vikander, the pitching coach who wrote the book with Bill Dembski and Alex Thomas, tells the Guardian. \u201cBut it also talks to the foibles that all of us as individuals have.\u201d    Indeed, so much about Dalkowski is legend. Hundreds of newspaper obituaries were written about Dalkowski, but Vikander says most contained errors.    Chiappetta, who \u201cbarely scratched the surface\u201d with his documentary, says that Dalkowski\u2019s \u201clegend continues. One reason why is that people can\u2019t get enough about his life.\u201d    This much we know: Dalkowski, a lefthander, was 5ft 10in and 170lb, not a particularly intimidating mound presence. But he was astonishingly fast and wild, with 1,324 strikeouts \u2013 and 1,236 bases on balls \u2013 over 956 innings pitched from 1957 to 1965. He had 262 strikeouts and 262 walks over 170 innings for the Class C Stockton Ports in 1960.    His four-seam fastball, called his \u201cradio pitch\u201d because batters could hear it but not see it, was practically unhittable \u2026 when it streaked over home plate. But just as many pitches sailed over batters\u2019 heads, even into the stands. It was said he once hit a fan waiting in line for a hot dog.    He was known for throwing pure heat, but there was no way back then to quantify just how fast he threw. People swear he threw 110 miles an hour, maybe even faster. (New York Yankees reliever Aroldis Chapman holds the documented record: 105.8 mph.)    \u201cThat\u2019s part of the mystique, for sure,\u201d Chiappetta said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t have the technology back then to prove it.\u201d    Although several rudimentary attempts were made to measure the speed of his pitches, Dalkowski ended his pro career nearly a decade before a radar gun was first used for Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Fame pitcher. And Dalkowski\u2019s career had peaked in the spring of 1963.    That was when Dalkowski, all but certain to earn a spot with the Baltimore Orioles, felt a pop in his left elbow, possibly a torn ligament, though his injury was never diagnosed. (The pitcher Tommy John underwent groundbreaking reconstructive elbow surgery in 1974, which is routinely used to correct such injuries now.)    The director and screenwriter Ron Shelton, a former Orioles\u2019 farmhand, said he based the fast, wild and immature character \u201cNuke\u201d LaLoosh, played by Tim Robbins, on Dalkowski in the classic 1988 baseball film Bull Durham. But there was a critical difference in their stories.    Bull Durham ends with LaLoosh in the big leagues, a prospect polished by hard lessons learned in the minors. But Dalkowski never pitched in a regular-season game at higher than the Triple-A level. He was an alcoholic, and his life, like his radio pitch, spun out of control.    And that became part of his legend, too. Sports in those days were not as scientific as now. There were no pitch counts to nurture a pitcher\u2019s arm. Dalkowski once threw 283 pitches in a single game \u2013 120 is considered excessive nowadays. Managers often had him warm up, and settle down, by tiring him out first.    \u201cPitchers were expected to pitch nine innings back then \u2013 \u2018Come on! Be a man!\u2019\u201d Vikander said.    Far less time was spent on mechanics, even on strategy on how to approach batters. For example, Vikander said half of all hitters then as now take the first pitch, so Dalkowski might have benefitted from simply bearing down to throw, say, a curveball for a first-pitch strike.    \u201cThere was information there that could have done things for Steve,\u201d Vikander said.    Though Dalkowski did briefly have a solid father-son-type relationship with Earl Weaver, who would later become the Orioles\u2019 legendary manager, virtually no attention was paid back then to an athlete\u2019s mental state, especially to those who struggled with high expectations.    \u201cHe wasn\u2019t set up psychologically to cope with that,\u201d Vikander said of Dalkowski\u2019s fame.    Chiappetta said, \u201cHe had no coaching. No baseball coaching, no life coaching, no coaching of anything. If he\u2019d be coming through baseball now, it\u2019s a whole different world.\u201d    Dalkowski took odd jobs after he left baseball , disappearing altogether from family and friends, sometimes sleeping in alleys, next to, or in, garbage cans. He was found alone, disheveled, in a laundromat in California on Christmas Eve 1992.    He did, however, have a piece of scrap paper with the phone number of a former teammate, Frank Zupo, and his life would change for the better because of help he received from his sister, Pat, and the Baseball Assistance Team, among many others.    \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of just going down the drain, and I don\u2019t have to do that to stop this Mickey Mouse drinking stuff to get my act together,\u201d Dalkowski said in an interview with Chiappetta earlier in 1992 that is included in the documentary.    He added: \u201cYou know who I hurt the most? God bless her soul \u2013 my sister. I cry about it at night. It\u2019s too bad. I had everything on the platter. I just dumped it in the toilet, and I guess I flushed it.\u201d    The happier part of his story is that Dalkowski spent the last 26 years of his life at an elder-care facility in New Britain, where he became somewhat of a celebrity for being a local kid who became a minor-leaguer with dazzling potential \u2013 potential being the operative word.    \u201cHe got 26 years of his life back,\u201d Chiappetta said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot longer than he played baseball.\u201d    The search for information continues, in part because Dalkowski never made it to the big leagues, where information can be more easily found. Plus, Dalkowski stopped pitching 55 years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for guys who played \u2018D\u2019 [level] ball with him in 1957,\u201d Vikander says.    Early response to the book, Vikander said, has been \u201cstellar,\u201d which makes him hopeful that more information about him can be found and sent to the book\u2019s website. Chiappetta is convinced there is old film \u2013 somewhere \u2013 of Dalko pitching.    \u201cThe story just kind of continues,\u201d Chiappetta says.    If a film clip does surface, perhaps from a dusty attic, it may be possible to measure the speed of Dalkowski\u2019s frighteningly fast, four-seam fastball. If we know for sure that he threw less than, say, 105.8 mph, his legend would surely diminish.But, then again, what if the clip shows that Dalko threw much faster?", "Adebayo's extension makes it far more difficult for Miami to open max cap space in 2021 free agency.", "Lavar Ball believes you can only be the GOAT based on how well you played during your wins.", "The Raiders have a Johnathan Abram problem that needs to be solved", "With Joe Burrow and Rex Burkhead out with season-ending injuries, Andy Behrens and Scott Pianowski highlight a couple players to consider rostering.", "More positive tests have been returned for the Baltimore Ravens.", "Mike Tyson sat down with UFC commentator Joe Rogan on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast to talk about how the Roy Jones Jr. comeback fight came about.\n\n\nIs it surprising that it started with a treadmill and the offer to fight Bob Sapp?\n\n\n(Video courtesy of JRE Clips)\n\n\n\n\n\nTRENDING > Khabib Nurmagomedov teases meeting with Dana White; does retirement decision loom?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Video > Dana White freaks out over Mike Tyson vs Roy Jones Jr. rules and limits\n\n\n\n(Subscribe to\u00a0MMAWeekly.com on YouTube)", "The fantasy playoffs are on the horizon, and we have a collection of pickups to help guide you to the end-game.", "With the fantasy playoff push in full force, you have to make every roster spot count.

Most of the others trying solve the last remaining self-driving puzzles are more cautious, targeting 2020 or later.", "The road to autonomy is long and exceedingly complicated. It can also be dangerous: Two high-profile efforts, from Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc., were involved in recent crashes that caused the death of a pedestrian (in the first known case of a person killed by a self-driving vehicle) and a driver using an assistance program touted as a precursor to autonomy. One of Waymo's autonomous vans was involved in a collision just last week. But the perceived stakes are so enormous, with the promise of transport businesses needing little in labor costs, that many players are racing to master the technology and put it to work.", "Without drivers, operating margins could be ... more than twice what carmakers generate right now", "In the next three years, almost all of these contenders will be able show off cars capable of navigating city streets at casual speeds along firmly fixed routes. Most of the companies now building autonomous vehicles can already handle basic driving at low speeds. This can give an impression of parity and sameness. Yet despite being in its infancy, autonomous driving has leaders starting to emerge.", "\"Waymo has developed a phenomenal system and is ahead of the pack,\" said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group's U.S. automotive practice, who singled out the top two. \"But that's very different from being able to manufacture an autonomous vehicle. You have to look at GM. In Europe, Daimler is leading the pack.\"", "The finish line isn't just reaching Level 4 on the five-step scale of autonomous driving. That's the threshold at which a car can drive on pre-mapped routes and handle anything on its planned course without the intervention of a driver. Only Waymo has tested Level 4 vehicles on passengers who aren't its employees--and those people volunteered to be test subjects. No one has yet demonstrated at Level 5, where the car is so independent that there's no steering wheel.", "The victors will also need to pioneer businesses around the technology. Delivery and taxi services capable of generating huge profits is the end game for all.", "Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts that robo-taxis will help the ride-hailing and -sharing business grow from $5 billion in revenue today to $285 billion by 2030. There are grand hopes for this business. Without drivers, operating margins could be in the 20 percent range, more than twice what carmakers generate right now. If that kind of growth and profit come to pass--very big ifs--it would be almost three times what GM makes in a year. And that doesn't begin to count the money to be made in delivery.", "Why does it matter who gets there first? To make a driverless business work takes a big fleet to establish service in major markets, as well as a brand name that becomes as synonymous with getting a ride as Uber is today. Observers expect the field to narrow.", "For now, investors are throwing money at possible winners", "\"There won't be a ton of companies doing this,\" Collie said. \"There will be a select few. Being there first establishes consumer trust. Brand value matters.\"", "For now, investors are throwing money at possible winners. Tesla's valuation soared in 2016 after an analyst from Morgan Stanley, also its lead underwriter, speculated that the company's electric cars would spawn a self-driving fleet. GM shares are up 20 percent since a June 2017 announcement that a plant to build driverless vehicles was up and running. Zoox Inc. has already raised $360 million, a huge sum for a startup with no revenue.", "Of course, the era when most people ditch their driver's licenses and rely on self-driving taxis remains far off. The technology costs more than the cars, and with few players actually testing the cars for the public, widespread adoption is years away. Even Waymo is still in the pilot stage.", "The most aggressive forecasts have the majority of people driving their own cars for at least the next decade. Chris Urmson, founder of Aurora Innovation INC. and one of the pioneers of the field, counts as one of the optimists. \"I can see these on the road in real numbers in five to 10 years,\" he said. That means even today's laggards have time to catch up.", "After interviewing executives and technology experts and reviewing announced plans, Bloomberg has taken a snapshot of the race to develop the self-driving car. Our estimated time of autonomy is based on Level 4, the prerequisite for launching businesses with self-driving tech.", "The Clear Leaders", "Waymo has run self-driving cars over 5 million road miles in 25 cities and done billions of miles in computer simulation, which it uses to update its self-driving software on a weekly basis. The Google-launched company has a fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans that can navigate city streets in San Francisco and reach full speed on highways.", "A pilot program of driverless vans will begin commercial service later this year, picking up paying passengers in Phoenix and branching out from there. Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik recently announced a deal to add 20,000 Jaguar I-Pace SUVs to the fleet and signaled that an in-the-works alliance with Honda Motor Co. could focus on delivery and logistics.", "The company also has by far the lowest rate of disengagement--times when an engineer needs to grab the wheel because the bot couldn't handle it--among all companies testing cars in California, a hub of autonomous research that also requires detailed disclosures. It also reported fewer accidents while testing in California last year: Waymo had three collisions over more than 350,000 miles, while GM had 22 over 132,000 miles.", "GM's Chevy Bolt can navigate the busy streets of San Francisco at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. The Detroit automaker is so confident that it plans to run a ride-hailing pilot next year in a car with no steering wheel or pedals, something only Waymo has done in road testing.", "After Waymo, a handful of major players have demonstrated similar driving capabilities. It's hard to say anyone has an edge. One advantage for GM: There's a factory north of Detroit that can crank out self-driving Bolts. That will help GM get manufacturing right and lower costs without relying on partners. Right now, an autonomous version of the car costs around $200,000 to build, compared to a sticker price of $35,000 for an electric Bolt for human drivers.", "Where GM lags Waymo is speed. GM doesn't test faster than 25 miles per hour, deeming that the safest top speed. Kyle Vogt, founder and chief executive of GM's Cruise Automation unit, said his program will soon be using new Lidar developed by Strobe, which the automaker acquired last year. Lidar sends out laser beams to map the road ahead and guide the car, and Strobe's version is smaller, cheaper and can see farther ahead than GM's existing equipment. That will enable faster driving.", "The new equipment will also cut costs. Lidar alone on the current generation of autonomous Bolts costs about $30,000 a car, Vogt said in November. When GM starts using Strobe, Vogt said, the cost will drop to \"hundreds of dollars.\"", "GM plans to spend $1 billion of its $8 billion annual capital expenditure budget to develop self-driving cars and mobility services. That money will allow GM the option of developing its own ride-hailing business. GM has not decided whether to run its ride-share pilot, slated for late 2019, on its own or to join forces with an established player. It's worth noting that the automaker already has a stake in Lyft Inc.", "There's a big caveat with GM: It leads all companies that test in California when it comes to fender benders. Last year, Cruise had 22 of the 27 accidents in the state involving driverless cars, and it experienced five of the seven incidents reported this year. The accidents have mostly been minor and not the fault of GM's car. In an interview, GM President Dan Ammann attributed the higher incident rate to the greater number of miles traveled in San Francisco's busy streets.", "Staying Close", "Mercedes-Benz started selling an adaptive cruise-control system in the late 1990s on its flagship S-class sedan. The system could sense when the car was bearing down too quickly on someone's rear bumper up ahead.", "Today, Mercedes models with Intelligent Drive get closer to real self-driving because the system can help steer clear of pedestrians and avoid other accidents. It's one reason why Navigant Research, which studies auto technology, ranked parent company Daimler third behind Waymo and GM.", "Those systems help today's drivers. For the cars of tomorrow, Daimler works closely with Robert Bosch Gmbh and will be using a system from Silicon Valley intelligent computing company Nvidia Corp. The test cars can drive at Level 4 autonomy or even Level 5, which means the car doesn't need a steering wheel or pedals to operate.", "The company has been testing V-Class vans around the roads of Boeblingen, near Stuttgart, where Mercedes-Benz has a research center. The automated vans run through purposefully challenging situations such as morning traffic. The technology is already at Level 5, Daimler's head of development, Ola Kaellenius, said in an interview, although a recent report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance put the target date for the company after 2020.", "Before those systems are on the road, Kaellenius said Mercedes will offer Level 3 autonomy as an option in the cars it sells by 2021. This means that the car can handle most driving while prompting the driver to take over in certain situations that the computer can't handle.", "Fully self-driving cars will be on the road at the same time, he said, but would be used for ride sharing services, because they would be too expensive for retail customers to buy. \"The logical business case there is a mobility service, a robo-taxi type of thing,\" Kaellenius said. \"You amortize the cost through the saving on the driver.\"", "No one would have imagined a decade ago that a vestige of bankrupt GM parts unit Delphi would be a player in the self-driving revolution. But Aptiv Plc, the former Delphi Automotive that split out its powertrain business, has emerged as a player to be watched, said Grayson Brulte, co-founder of Brulte & Co., a consulting firm that specializes in autonomous strategy.", "Aptiv has invested heavily in self-driving technology, buying software maker Ottomatika along with stakes in Lidar makers Innoviz, Leddertech and Quanergy Systems. Its biggest deal was buying NuTonomy, which has been running tests of driverless cars in Boston and Singapore at city speeds. The company also ran a robo-taxi demo in Las Vegas during CES.", "The company has been testing ride-hailing services in Singapore since 2016 and will have them operational in 2021, according to Navigant. Aptiv has been working with Audi AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG cars to develop its technology.", "The same day in late November that GM showed off its self-driving Bolt in San Francisco, Zoox Inc. had its own car driving through the city's winding streets and heavy traffic. Zoox has about 250 engineers working to develop it. Its self-driving Toyota Highlander SUVs run on the same busy streets that GM uses to test the Bolt. But Zoox's car can also drive at highway speeds, said Bert Kaufman, head of corporate and regulatory affairs for Zoox.", "The company plans to have its car ready for passengers in 2020, Kaufman said, and then will work on getting passengers in the car shortly after.", "The challenge for Zoox is getting more funding to build its car. The company has raised more than $280 million but needs an additional cash to finish its car, Kaufman said. It can cost $1 billion for car companies to finish a new model. Established carmakers have their own vehicles, and Waymo has partnerships with manufacturers.", "Renault-Nissan Alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn brags that the company has sold more cars with adaptive safety than anyone. Nissan's ProPilot system stops the car if a vehicle ahead stops quickly and it keeps the car in its lane.", "That system was developed on the way to a full autonomous system, Ghosn said in an interview earlier this year. Right now, Nissan is testing a fully-autonomous car in Palo Alto, California. Renault recently showed off a long, sleek, copper-colored concept car called the Symbioz that can go 80 miles per hour in full self-drive mode.", "The car still requires a driver to turn on autonomous mode, at which point the steering wheel retracts. With electric motors in front and back and measuring a lane-hogging six feet in width and 16 feet in length, Symbioz isn't exactly the car that will go on sale.", "In March, Nissan tested an electric Leaf in a ride-hailing pilot in Yokohama, and Renault will do the same later this year in suburban Paris and Rouen with the electric Renault Zoe.", "While the alliance's technology is impressive, Ghosn sounds cautious. The French-Japanese conglomerate plans to test a self-driver on the road around 2020. That car will be on highways requiring only occasional driver intervention. By 2022, Renault-Nissan will have fully autonomous cars in the road, according to the Alliance 2022 plan.", "\"We will all be coming to market with this by 2022,\" Ghosn said. \"You'll see all of the carmakers with some level of autonomy.\"", "Audi, the luxury brand owned by Volkswagen AG, already has the most advanced autonomous car for sale in the A8. The car's Traffic Jam Pilot uses Lidar to see the road and lets drivers go completely hands-free at speeds up to 37 miles per hour.", "The company's future work promises to be much more advanced. Audi, which is working with Nvidia, is targeting a fully autonomous car in 2020; the report from BNEF put the date to reach Level 4 at 2021. The company hasn't said whether it will be tested in a service or by its own engineers.", "Volkswagen also has an agreement with Aurora, the startup whose founders have serious cred in the world of self-driving software.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV recently joined the partnership, which plans to have self-driving technology in production vehicles by 2021.", "The self-driving BMWs aren't ready for the highways, BMW Chief Finance Officer Nicolas Peter said at a press event in Detroit. \"This technology requires, from our perspective, some more time to have really fully automated cars on the road,\" Peter said. There are currently about 1,000 people on the company's research and development team.", "No one can count Toyota Motor Corp. out. The company started developing self-parking technology in 1999 and installed it in the Prius in Japan in 2003, enabling the car to park with no input from the driver.", "Toyota kept mum about capabilities until CES in January, when the company showed off a boxy shuttle concept called e-Palette. The Japanese automaker can make the self-driving shuttle in three sizes and it will debut publicly at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 as a ride-hailing shuttle, said Gill Pratt, who runs Toyota Research Institute.", "Still, Toyota's message was one of patience. When Toyota tests its self-driving car in 2020, it may not have a driver--or it may still have two people minding the front seats and the controls, Pratt said.", "He thinks a lot of carmakers and tech companies are hyping the true state of self-driving vehicles. \"We will get there,\" Pratt said, \"but I can't tell you when.\"", "Ford Motor Co. has been considered a laggard, especially since former CEO Mark Fields was fired last year, in part for not having a cohesive vision for autonomy and future mobility. But it's not fair to say Ford is flat-footed. The company gets its technology from Argo AI, the artificial intelligence company in Pittsburgh that Ford paid $1 billion to take a significant stake last year. That investment brought in very good capabilities, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Navigant Research.", "The Argo team has a strong lineage. The startup is the brainchild of Bryan Salesky, who was director of hardware development of what is now Waymo, and Peter Rander, who was engineering lead at the Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Salesky's experience dates back to the beginning of self-driving cars: He was senior software engineer on the winning team in the 2007 autonomous vehicle challenge funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).", "Ford is now testing its third-generation Fusion sedan with Argo's technology. Even with Argo, however, Ford got a late start. When Ford bought the startup in February 2017, the company had few employees and Salesky spent a year staffing up.", "The plan is to have self-driving cars with Level 4 capability in 2021, said Sherif Markaby, Ford's vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification. The car will be purpose-built for autonomy that has no steering wheel or pedals.

The pits usually comprise a pit lane which runs parallel to the start/finish straight and is connected at each end to the main track, and a row of garages (usually one per team) outside which the work is done. Pit stop work is carried out by anywhere from two to twenty mechanics (also called a \"pit crew\"), depending on the series regulations, while the driver often waits in the vehicle (except where a driver change is involved or in Motorbike racing).", "Depending on the circuit, the garage may be located on pit lane or in a separate area.", "In most series the order of the teams' pit boxes is assigned by points standings, race results, or previous qualifying results before the start of the race.

In races where there are different series racing together, each series has its own separate garage or are parked in their own area.  Circuits in other parts of the world (used in Formula One) typically have the individual garages open directly onto the pit lane through the team's assigned pit box. In American English, it is common to drop the definite article and just refer to \"pit road\", whereas in British English one would always refer to  \"the pit lane\". A further difference is that in British English, the term \"pit box\" is universally used, whereas in American English, one would say \"pit stall\". It is important to note that in NASCAR, a pit box is a tool (see below), though there is a definitive term used for them.", "Where it is permitted, refuelling is often an important purpose of a pit stop. Carrying fuel slows down a vehicle and there is often a limit on the size of the fuel tank, so many races require multiple stops for fuel to complete the race distance in the minimum time. Changing tyres is also common to permit the use of softer tyres that wear faster but provide more grip, to use tyres suitable for wet conditions, or to use a range of tyres designated by the rules. Teams will aim for each of their vehicles to pit following a planned schedule, with the number of stops determined by many factors such as fuel capacity, tyre lifespan, and the trade-off between time lost in the pits versus time gained on the track due to the benefits of pit stops. Choosing the optimum pit strategy of how many stops to make and when to make them is crucial in having a successful race. It is also important for teams to take competitors' strategies into account when planning pit stops to avoid being held up behind a competitor where overtaking is difficult or risky. An unscheduled or extended stop, such as for a repair, can be very costly for a driver's chance of success, because while they are stopped for service, competitors remaining on the track are gaining time on them. For this reason, the pit crew often undergo intensive training to perform operations such as tyre changes as quickly as possible leading to pit stops, for example in Formula 1, where the car is only stationary for a few seconds for a regular pit stop.", "", "In any racing series that permits scheduled pit stops, pit strategy becomes one of the most important features of the race; this is because a race car travelling at 100 miles per hour (160 kilometres per hour) will travel approximately 150 feet (45 metres) per second.  During a ten-second pit stop, a car's competitors will gain approximately one-quarter mile (400 metres) over the stopped car.", "However, the car that made the additional pit stop will run faster on the race track than cars that did not make the stop, both because it can carry a smaller amount (and thus lower weight) of fuel, and will also have less wear on its tyres, providing more traction and allowing higher speeds in the corners.  In racing series where teams have their choice of different compound tyres, the lower tyre wear may be enough to allow the team to choose to use a tyre with a softer rubber compound that provides increased grip at the expense of faster wear; going longer between stops may even cause enough wear on the softer tyre to cause the tyres to fail.", "Because of this, race teams plan a pit strategy prior to the start of every race.  This is a schedule for each car's planned pit stops during the race, and takes into account factors such as rate of fuel consumption, weight of fuel, cornering speed with each available tyre compound, rate of tyre wear, the effect of tyre wear on cornering speed, the length of pit road and the track's pit road speed limit, and even expected changes in weather and lighting conditions.  The pit strategy does not just include a schedule of when pit stops will happen; it also includes what service and adjustments are scheduled for each pit stop, particularly in endurance racing, where scheduled changes of wear-limited parts such as brake pads may be planned for specific points during the race.  The pit strategy is calculated carefully so that the amount of time to be \"given away\" to other competitors in pit stops is balanced out by the time gained while on the track, resulting, theoretically, in the shortest possible time to cover the scheduled distance.", "However, a team's pit strategy is not a fixed, immutable thing; it is subject to change during the race to take into account the unpredictable events that happen in every race.  In road racing, for example, if the weather changes from dry to rain, teams will be forced to recalculate their pit strategy based on the unscheduled stop to change from dry-weather \"slick\" tyres to treaded wet-weather tyres.  Safety car periods often see mass pit stops by many teams, hoping to take advantage of the slowed pace to reduce the ground lost to other teams while making pit stops; this forces teams that do so to immediately recalculate their pit strategy to optimize it for the remaining race distance after the stop.", "Even when a team chooses not to take advantage of the opportunity to stop during a full-course caution, it can still result in significant changes to pit strategy; under caution, the cars run at a reduced speed that results in greatly reduced tyre wear and fuel burn for a distance travelled.  Depending on the circumstances, this may be enough for a team to gain more by choosing not to pit, hoping that the reduced fuel burn and tyre wear will allow them to make one pit stop fewer than the other teams, allowing them to gain distance and time on their opponents.  At tracks noted for frequent full-course cautions, teams may even plan their entire race strategy around this, using a suspension and aerodynamic setup suited to short sprints instead of extended runs to gain positions in the short bursts of green-flag racing, and planning their pit strategy on the assumption that cautions will extend their fuel mileage and tyre wear enough to make fewer stops than would otherwise be needed to complete the race distance.", "", "During a scheduled pit stop, the team's pit crew services the vehicle as quickly as possible, completing a number of different services.  The most common services performed are refuelling (where permitted) and changing tyres.", "Other services performed in routine pit stops include removing debris from radiator air intakes; cleaning the windscreen; and making adjustments to tyre pressure, suspension settings, and aerodynamic devices to optimize the vehicle's performance for the current conditions.  In endurance racing, scheduled driver changes and brake pad replacements are also considered \"routine\" service when done as part of a scheduled pit stop.", "An unscheduled pit stop may see other services performed; because unscheduled stops are often due to damage or mechanical problems, they may include emergency repairs and replacement of parts.", "In some forms of racing, a team may be ordered to bring a vehicle into the pits as a penalty and either drive through the pit lane at the maximum permitted speed or remain stationary in their pit box for a specified period of time. During this time no services can be performed.[1]", "", "In Formula One, mid-race refuelling has been banned since 2010, and cars make pit stops with the primary purpose of changing tyres.  Teams sometimes also make adjustments to the front and rear wings and perform minor repairs, most commonly replacing the nose and front wing assembly. A pit stop typically take 2 to 3 seconds to complete. Red Bull Racing holds the current world record for the fastest pit stop, with a 1.82 second stop performed at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix on Max Verstappen. Pit strategies generally call for between one and four scheduled stops, depending on the circuit. The drives between pit stops are commonly known as 'stints'.", "When the car is approximately one lap away from making its stop, the team's pit crew will set up fresh tyres and all needed pit equipment. Because of the overhead pneumatic rig, the team may have all pit mechanics in position prior to the car's arrival, with the exception of the rear jack man.", "Unlike almost all other forms of racing that feature routine pit stops, Formula One rules limit teams to a single pit crew for the mandatory two cars entered. Most other racing series that feature routine pit stops permit each car its own pit stall and crew. Therefore, teams must stagger their pit schedules so that only one of their two cars is in the pits at any given time, otherwise, one car must wait for the other car to finish services. However, with proper timing or in special conditions (for example, in the period immediately after the safety car being called out), it is possible for teams to pit both cars on the same lap without losing significant time - the 'double stack' strategy. This allows both of the team's drivers to race on equally fresh tyres, preventing either from having an advantage over the other, and helps the team hide the relative performance between two cars to other teams when only one car is in the pits.", "One strategy commonly used in Formula One pit stops is the 'undercut' involving two cars battling for track position. In this strategy, the car behind makes an earlier pitstop than the leading car; if successful, the car behind should be able to utilize the advantage of having fresh tyres to reduce the lead of the car they are attempting to overtake. If the gap between the two cars is reduced to less than the time lost in a pit stop, when the leading car pits, the leading car will exit the pits behind the car which pitted first. This strategy is especially effective when the leading car is stuck in traffic and/or if the car behind has clear track to push on, but can be negated if the car behind gets stuck in traffic after their early pitstop or is unable to drive fast enough to neutralize the advantage of the leading car. Similarly, there is the reverse (but less common) strategy of the overcut, where the leading car stays out on their older tyres longer and laps fast enough to maintain or even extend their advantage over the car behind - this strategy may be successful if the leading car's tyres are still in good shape when the car behind pits, sufficiently so that the leading car can push without being overly limited by tyre degradation, or if the car behind gets stuck in traffic, thus negating their ability to utilise their fresher tyres to their advantage.", "Refuelling, now banned in F1 races, was permitted from the 1994 season to the 2009 season. During this period, a pit stop involved about twenty mechanics, with the aim of completing the stop as quickly as possible. Stops generally lasted for six to twelve seconds depending on how much fuel was put into the car. However, if there was a problem, such as a fuel pump failing or the engine stalling, or repairs having to be made, it could take much longer. Cars were fuelled at a rate of more than 12 litres per second. This was accomplished by a fairly complex closed system that pumped air out of the car's fuel tank as the fuel was being pumped in.", "Since fuel was a significant portion of a car's weight, teams varied the amount of fuel loaded into a car at any given stop (and prior to the race) and thus vary the number of pit stops. The most common strategies seen were one stop and two stop strategies; two stop strategies were employed to increase the car's speed/improve lap times to catch cars ahead, whereas one-stop strategies were used to gain time and track position to cars ahead with the advantage of one fewer pit stop. However, teams could and sometimes did opt for unorthodox pit strategies with multiple (3+) pit stops, as was employed by Ferrari and Michael Schumacher with four stops at the 2004 French Grand Prix which he eventually won.", "As refuelling was a potentially hazardous situation, the mechanics wore fire-resistant multi-layer suits and flame-resistant gloves, long underwear, balaclava, socks and shoes, which had to meet the guidelines set by FIA Standard 8856-2000.[2]", "Deprecated roles", "For its first four seasons, pit stops in Formula E served the primary purpose of changing cars - since FE cars did not yet contain the necessary electric charge to complete a full race, drivers needed to switch cars during the race. With the exception of repairing damaged tyres, no other mechanic services were allowed to be performed on the cars during the pit stop.", "Prior to the 2017\u201318 season, the rule and scoring system in Formula E allowed for some unusual pit stop strategies. Previously, drivers scored one point for setting the fastest lap in the race regardless of finishing position (or whether they finished the race at all); hence a driver with no chance at finishing in the point-scoring positions for whatever reason could switch cars, wait for the prematurely right moment to come out of the pits and set the fastest lap of the race. Notably, this was seen in the 2016 London ePrix, when championship contenders S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Lucas di Grassi utilised this strategy after their first lap crash rendered them otherwise unable to score points; Buemi ended up with the fastest lap, winning the Formula E 2016 drivers\u2019 championship as a direct result. For the 2017\u201318 season, Formula E's rules were amended to restrict the additional point for fastest lap to drivers finishing in the top 10 only, rendering the aforementioned strategy obsolete.", "For its fifth season (2018\u201319) new cars were introduced which had batteries capable of completing the entire race distance. As such pit stops were no longer used during races other than in the event of repairing damages.[3]", "Crew chiefs lead the pit crew during pit stops in addition to coaching the driver during the race.  Pit crew members were once the mechanics on the racecar, but most teams feature individuals dedicated to pit stops only, and often former collegiate or professional athletes are used for pit stops.  Former NFL player Tim Goad is regarded as the first former professional athlete involved in a pit crew, as a jackman. Nonetheless, some pit crew members work with the team in fabricating or designing the race cars during the week while training for their \"pit job\" on the weekends.  Teams have built full training centers similar to that of professional athletes for their pit crews.", "There are a number of penalties that can be incurred on a pit stop. The driver must keep the car below the pit road speed from the pit entrance to the pit exit; the speed limit is typically 35-55\u00a0mph, depending on the size of the track. Teams can be penalized if the car is serviced outside of the designated pit stall, if the car drives over an air hose, or if any of the old tires are not on the pit wall side (usually left) of the vehicle's centerline before the car leaves. The most common penalty for a pit infraction is a \"drive-through\": the driver must enter the pits again, under the green flag, and maintain the pit speed limit for the entire length of pit road. If a car stalls, the pit crew may provide a push start, but the car cannot be pushed beyond three pit stalls ahead of its own, or beyond the pit exit light and steward at the end of pit road.", "Pit stops are timed from the moment the car stops in its pit stall, until service is finished and the car leaves the stall. A pit stop for four tires and fuel can last 12 to 16 seconds, and a stop for two tires and fuel may take 5 to 7 seconds. Late in a race, a team may only need a small amount of fuel to make it to finish; this is called a \"splash and go\" and may take as little as 2 to 3 seconds. These times depend upon any suspension adjustments performed and the quality of the crew.", "NASCAR Cup Series team pit strategies vary widely, depending on the track. Fuel is generally a more limiting factor than tire wear, and the phrase \"fuel window\" or \"pit window\" is used to indicate the maximum number of laps possible with a full load of fuel, assuming continuous green flag conditions and a small reserve. The window is used to calculate (or recalculate after a stop) the minimum number of pit stops required to complete the race. The road courses on the schedule may see as few as two scheduled stops; oval race tracks generally see between four and six scheduled stops. Races at short tracks such as Bristol Motor Speedway and Martinsville Speedway are short enough to be completed with only two scheduled stops for fuel, but teams plan on more stops due to rapid tire wear and significant loss of cornering speed on worn tires.  If one team pits for tires and is considerably faster (between 1 and 3 seconds per lap), then teams will usually follow quickly to avoid losing time.", "Pit strategy can play a significant role in the outcome of a NASCAR race, perhaps more so than other racing series. Under caution, most teams use similar strategies to avoid being caught alone, typically following the leader's decision to stay out or pit, but sometimes teams will deliberately pit \"off-sequence\" if they feel they can gain an advantage later. Race tactics can affect strategy as well. Late in a race, drivers can reduce throttle input to save fuel at the cost of slower lap times, but by doing so they can stretch their pit window to the end of the race and skip the final pit stop. A late caution can force teams to make a tough call: Stay out on worn tires, or pit and give up track position. The green-white-checker rule can cause headaches, as it can potentially extend the race an unknown number of both green-flag and yellow-flag laps.  Furthermore, strategy can be determined by qualifying position.  A team that qualifies in the top six positions will have the best choice of pit stalls, most often choosing the first, last, or a stall with an opening either in front of or behind that one.  A team that qualifies deeper in the field will have a greater opportunity to be stacked behind cars during a pit stop, slowing them down.", "In the IndyCar Series, a pit stop is a more complex operation than in NASCAR, but far less so than in Formula One. Rules permit six mechanics over the pit wall during a stop. The pit rules and procedures have origins in USAC National Championship racing. The spare fuel for IndyCar competition is stored in large pitside fuel tanks. Each team's tank is filled to a specified volume of fuel, depending upon the race distance. Teams are also given a certain allotment of spare tires sets, likewise owing to the race distance. All of the spare tires are pre-mounted on wheels before the race.", "During a routine pit stop, the tires are laid out beforehand, and three of the four tire changers are pre-positioned before the car enters its pit stall. The fourth tire changer, whose responsibility is the rear tire on the far side of pit road from the pit wall, does not take his position until after the car arrives, due to a rule against having the car run over the feed hose for the impact wrench used to change the tires, and a prohibition of using an overhead boom to support air hoses. As a result, the outside rear changer also serves to wave at the driver to inform him of where his pit box is while holding the air hose up.", "As soon as the car comes to a halt, the first step, taken while the fourth tire changer assumes his position, is for a mechanic to activate the car's built-in pneumatic jacks. A pressurized air hose is inserted into a receiving nozzle at the rear of the car, under the rear wing. Previously, this device was inserted on the side of the car, but for safety reasons, the location was moved in the 2000s. At the same instant, another crew member begins the refueling process. A fueling hose is inserted into a socket (called the \"buckeye\"), allowing a gravity-fed hose to refill the car's fuel tank. The fuel hose has a built-in vent/overflow hose as part of the mechanism, an invention of the mid-2000s. Previously, a second \"vent hose\" was utilized, but it was phased out to improve safety.", "Simultaneously, the four tire changers remove the wheels and install the new ones. IndyCar wheels are affixed to the hubs with a single lug nut, making it easier and faster to change them. After the tire changes are complete, the front tire changers may use manual adjusters to adjust the angle of the car's front wing, remove debris from air intakes, or make other minor repairs. While the service is being completed by the over-the-wall crew, another crew member behind the wall may use a stick to offer the driver a refreshment.", "After the tire changes are complete, the air jack hose is removed, dropping the car to the ground. However, the driver usually must wait additional seconds until the refueling is complete. The right front tire changer (who is usually also the crew chief) signals the driver when the stop is complete. Before the car departs its pit stall, a crew member must squirt water to wash any excess spilled fuel from the fuel buckeye; this is usually done with a pressurized water hose by a crew member behind the pit wall.", "Under normal conditions, a routine stop for an IndyCar team lasts between six and ten seconds. IndyCar teams are permitted to set their own pit strategies.", "In Super Formula, Japan's top-level single-seater series, a total of six mechanics are allowed to work on a car. Of these six, three have fixed roles: the lollipop-signalman, the refueler, and the fire-fighter. They are forbidden from undertaking any other function during the pit stop. The remaining three mechanics are responsible for all other operations, most notably jacking up the car and changing the tyres. The general strategy is to have the three free mechanics operate on the car in an assembly-line-like manner, moving around the car between different stations. Because of the limited personnel, teams often come up with creative solutions to decrease pit stop times. For example, some teams employ an automatic front jack, which is placed in front of the car as it stops. Mechanics might also jump over the nose-cone of the car to save time getting to the other side. With the automatic front jack, a Super Formula pit stop takes between ten to twelve seconds; even without the automatic jack, pit stops can be completed in as little as fourteen seconds.", "In the various forms of sports car endurance racing, pit stops are a more leisurely affair, but no less important than in other forms of racing. While stops take longer, much more routine maintenance is scheduled during such pit stops, needed to keep the car running for as long as twenty-four hours; this includes major aerodynamic changes to deal with the changing temperature in such a long race, and replacement of certain wear-limited parts, such as brake pads. Due to the fact that the race is scheduled to last a certain length of time rather than a specific distance, pit strategies are generally not designed to be synchronised with the race distance, but rather to happen on a schedule based on the car's requirements for routine service.", "Under the rules of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) only five mechanics are permitted to work on the car.  One man is permitted to fuel the car; all fuelling must be completed before any other service occurs. The other four mechanics on pit lane at any given time are typically two tyre changers and two tyre carriers, each of whom handles his task on only one side of the car. Automatic pneumatic jacks are used, integrated into the car itself.  At all times the car's engine must be shut off during the stop, and may start only when the stop has concluded.", "IMSA allows only four mechanics to service a car during a pit stop. One crew member will refuel the car while the other three are responsible for changing tyres and operating the pneumatic jacks. A fifth crew-member must serve as the team's designated firefighter and must stand ready in the pit stall with a fire extinguisher while the car is being refuelled. A sixth crew-member may assist in a driver change. Neither the firefighter or driver's assistant may perform any additional service to the car.[8] Unlike the ACO, IMSA does not force crews to wait for fuelling to complete before changing tyres, and does not require the car's engine be shut off during the stop.", "In endurance racing, driver changes are mandatory; the shortest endurance races are scheduled for four hours, one hour longer than the longest nonstop time permitted behind the wheel. During a pit stop with a driver change, the new driver and a driver change assistant are permitted into the pit lane. The assistant, who may not do any mechanical work on the car, is tasked with helping the current driver out of the car, removing or swapping driver seat inserts, helping the new driver into the car, and helping the new driver tightly fasten his safety harness and connect his various helmet connections to the car's systems, including the two-way team radio and the drink bottle used to stave off dehydration.", "A routine pit stop with no scheduled maintenance and no driver change generally lasts from thirty to forty seconds. With a driver change included, that time increases by about ten seconds. Should there be significant scheduled maintenance, such as changing brake pads, the stop can easily last well more than a minute.", "Unlike most other forms of racing, the practice of \"double-stinting\" or even \"triple-stinting\" tyres is commonplace in longer races; tyres hard enough to withstand the rigours of racing in the heat of the daytime may be so hard that they do not wear significantly during the nighttime hours. In a race where this is an issue, significant time can be gained by choosing to leave worn tyres on the car during the first stop after they were put on the car; if the temperature drops low enough, teams may even be able to go two pit stops without changing tyres.", ""]], "https://news4sanantonio.com/news/nation-world/nascar-to-host-races-without-fans-due-to-coronavirus-concerns": [{"h1": [], "h2": [], "h3": [], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, []], "https://insidemazda.mazdausa.com/the-mazda-way/motorsports/todays-mazda-drivers-race-yesterdays-winning-cars-reunion/": [{"h1": ["Today\u2019s Mazda Drivers Race Yesterday\u2019s Winning Cars at Reunion"], "h2": ["Explore The Mazda Line up", "Explore the Mazda Lineup"], "h3": ["Many Automakers Talk About Performance.

After a fire at Magny Cours that destroyed all the wiring, electronics and electrical parts the car was re-built in time for testing for Zolder. During testing there, we discovered a crack in the cylinder which meant an engine rebuild, and worst of all, no racing at Zolder. Despair was beginning to set in! However, Johan Kraan, our fabulous team manager, reassured us all would be perfect for Spa. And indeed it was, but we weren\u2019t to know at the time!", "So, we arrived at Spa on Thursday in preparation for sign on and driver briefing at the crack of dawn Friday morning. Spa holds a a special place in my heart as my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side was the Mayor of the town (I\u2019m half Belgian) and we spent Christmas, Easter and part of the summer holidays there every year since I was a baby. Going to see the races at Spa was one of the activities that was always on the calendar. In fact my grandfather presented Jim Clark with the winners trophy for the 1963 F1 grand prix. As a kid growing up around racing cars, my father was an amateur saloon car racer, driving at the mythical Spa track became a childhood dream, winning there was a wild fantasy! So onto free practice on Friday, the car indeed was perfect, Johan and his fabulous team of mechanics had done a fine job. The car was working perfectly, in fact, we set the 2nd fastest time in our category, happy days. After a few minor tweaks 2nd practice went well too. We were ready for qualifying Saturday morning and proceeded to get the fastest lap time 2 minutes before the session ended but we developed a gear selection problem, so had to abort the final quick lap to come into the pits. The issue was quickly identified but couldn\u2019t be fixed in time to go out again, so our rival's car no.303 pipped us to pole but we would be alongside them for a rolling start. Very happy with that! As a team we decided I would start the 1st race on Saturday and Jerome, my eldest son, would start the 2nd race on the Sunday.", "As you can see from the in car footage, I was a bit slow and was sneakily overtaken before the green lights by another competitor. Happily, I was able to overtake him and set off after our pole sitter. Things were going well as we were trading similar lap times until we had a slight brake problem. Late into the race the left front locked up and put me into a spin that pushed me down into 3rd place. The 2nd placed car then crashed, so we were back into 2nd at the time of the pit-stop and driver change. Jerome went out and was doing a fine job until the gearbox got stuck in 3rd gear, we were lapping but at 20 seconds a lap slower than the leading car, until the final minutes when they ran out of fuel, we overtook them one lap before the chequered flag and were extremely lucky to have won that race. The mechanics spent the rest of the day fixing the brakes and the gearbox sensor in readiness for the 2nd race!", "Onto Sunday...", "As we were winners on Saturday, 30 seconds was added to our pit stop time as a handicap (2nd place gets 25 seconds and 3rd place gets 20 seconds). This is quite a lot of time to make up and makes sitting in the car waiting to go seem interminable, especially in the heat. The temperature inside the car reaches a warm 46 Celsius, with the fireproofs, crash helmet and adrenaline coursing through the veins it makes it nice and toasty! Add to that a heart rate at 140 and it makes concentrating challenging!", "Anyway, Jerome was set to start on Sunday, and having learnt from my slow start that he needed to be stuck to the back of the car in front, he made a great start and led our class from the off building a nice 8 second cushion by the time he came in to hand to me after 30 minutes of our 60 minute + 1 lap race(this sentence is weird to me- maybe I'm not understanding the jargon?). As you might see from the film of our pit stop it isn\u2019t an elegant affair. In order to help the outgoing driver I grab him by the shoulder straps and pull him out and drop him on the ground so I can jthen ump in and prepare to drive. Only when I\u2019m in the car and the door closed can they fill the tank with fuel. While they are doing that I\u2019ve got to strap myself up with the 6 point harness, make sure the shoulder straps go over the hans device (this stops your head going too far forward in case of a frontal crash), hard enough without a crash helmet and gloves on with them and knowing that you have to be expeditious, makes it a challenge. They\u2019ve finished the fuel, I\u2019ve finished the seat belts, Jerome then opens the door to say the tyres are causing oversteer under heavy braking, something Johan told me before the race : Robin, beware with this heat, the tyres are going to be very slippery when it is your turn! And with our 8 second lead whittled down to nothing I rejoin the track with one thought, bring her home! I was very cautious for the first few laps and promptly got the hurry up from the pit wall waving me on eagerly each time I went by!", "With some racing cars, after you go over a kerb or a rumble strip you have to pump the brakes in order to prepare them for the next braking session and to go fast you have to take kerb and rumble strip, so each time you have to tap the brake pedal to prime them. If you don\u2019t disaster can strike, as it did in the first event; when my left brake locked on and threw the car sideways.", "Coming into the chicane 3 laps from the end of the race I didn\u2019t prime the brakes properly and so the car lurched left and put me into a spin. As I recovered I could see my 2 competitors drive past serenely. I knew I didn\u2019t have much time to get ahead and build a lead, but putting in some 2\u201942\u2019s I managed to catch and overtake them and build up a lead - enough to take the chequered flag and the limousine bus from parc ferme (place the cars go after the race) to the podium to celebrate our 2nd victory of the w-e! Realising a boyhood dream of winning a car race at Spa for the 2nd time. Dreams do come true!!!", "Robin and Jerome's next race is at the Zandvoort curcit on the 12th-14th July, so stay tuned on our social media channels for race and training updates.
