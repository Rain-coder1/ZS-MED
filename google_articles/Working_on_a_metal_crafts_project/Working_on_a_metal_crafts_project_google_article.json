You\u2019ve got hard metals, and you\u2019ve got soft metals. Some metals can be welded, and some can\u2019t. But metal art is a seriously impressive craft. Many sculpturists\u00a0enjoy it because it allows them to make something out of materials that would otherwise be thrown away.\u00a0Some of the best metal art sculptures are created from recycled or scrap metal. So not only does it look cool, it\u2019s resourceful too!", "The same goes for big metal companies in the manufacturing industry. It\u2019s more cost effective for them to use recycled metals over anything else. Blacksmithing, boilermakers, ironworkers all use metal fabrication (building metal structures through bending and cutting). Not surprisingly, metal is a billion dollar industry.", "Image Credit: http://pqhfabrications.co.uk/", "Aluminium and steel are both popular choices in the metal art world. Some prefer aluminium for its durability and white undertone. Others lean more towards stainless steel because it has the ability to produce beautiful colours when heated, and a delightful matt finish. Copper and bronze can create quite sophisticated metal art, offering quite a rustic feel to the masterpiece.", "Everywhere we look, there is metal. Now, we are not magic. We know we can\u2019t just look at a spoon and hope it will bend. Metals are generally malleable, meaning they can be bent out of shape without breaking. They are also fusible, and ductile. In short, we can do a hell of a lot with metal.", "Both extremely popular choices for making metal art sculptures. Scrap and recycled metals\u00a0can be reused over and over again. \u00a0They can be used both in the manufacturing industry or at home to make new furnishings and fixtures! Using scrap metal is a serious way to reduce waste (Hooray!)", "Some people ditch the high street stores and choose to make their own garden art from their very own studio! If you\u2019ve got the equipment, it can often be cheaper to make your own, plus it\u2019s a pretty cool hobby to have!

If you want to stick two metals together, you guessed it, you need a welder! There are\u00a0a few different types of welders, but I\u2019ll put this as simply as possible. Welding machines have two leads, one is negative (and always attached to the metal you\u2019ll be welding) and one is positive. Turn it on, and move the positive lead to what you want to weld and BOOM, sparks should fly!

The term covers a wide range of work from large ships and bridges to precise engine parts and delicate jewelry. It therefore includes a correspondingly wide range of skills, processes, and tools.", "Metalworking is a science, art,[1][2] hobby, industry and trade. Its historical roots span cultures, civilizations, and millennia. Metalworking has evolved from the discovery of smelting various ores, producing malleable and ductile metal useful tools and adornments. Modern metalworking processes, though diverse and specialized, can be categorized as forming, cutting, or joining processes. Today's machine shop includes a number of machine tools capable of creating a precise, useful workpiece.", "The oldest archaeological evidence of copper mining and working was the discovery of a copper pendant in northern Iraq from 8,700 BCE.[3] The earliest substantiated and dated evidence of metalworking in the Americas was the processing of copper in Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan. Copper was hammered until it became brittle, then heated so it could be worked further. This technology is dated to about 4000-5000 BCE.[4] The oldest gold artifacts in the world come from the Bulgarian Varna Necropolis and date from 4450 BCE.", "Not all metal required fire to obtain it or work it. Isaac Asimov speculated that gold was the \"first metal\".[5] His reasoning being, that, by its chemistry, it is found in nature as nuggets of pure gold. In other words, gold, as rare as it is, is sometimes found in nature as a native metal. Some metals can also be found in meteors. Almost all other metals are found in ores, a mineral-bearing rock, that require heat or some other process to liberate the metal. Another feature of gold is that it is workable as it is found, meaning that no technology beyond a stone hammer and anvil is needed to work the metal.  This is a result of gold's properties of malleability and ductility. The earliest tools were stone, bone, wood, and sinew, all of which sufficed to work gold.", "At some unknown time, the process of liberating metals from rock by heat became known, and copper rich rocks, tin, and lead came into demand. These ores were mined wherever they were recognized.  Remnants of such ancient mines have been found all over Southwestern Asia.[6] Metalworking was being carried out by the South Asian inhabitants of Mehrgarh between 7000\u20133300 BCE.[7] The end of the beginning of metalworking occurs sometime around 6000 BCE when copper smelting became common in Southwestern Asia.", "Ancient civilisations knew of seven metals. Here they are arranged in order of their oxidation potential (in volts):", "The oxidation potential is important because it is one indicator of how tightly bound to the ore the metal is likely to be.  As can be seen, iron is significantly higher than the other six metals while gold is dramatically lower than the six above it. Gold's low oxidation is one of the main reasons that gold is found in nuggets. These nuggets are relatively pure gold and are workable as they are found.", "Copper ore, being relatively abundant, and tin ore became the next important substances in the story of metalworking. Using heat to smelt copper from ore, a great deal of copper was produced. It was used for both jewelry and simple tools; However, copper by itself was too soft for tools requiring edges and stiffness. At some point tin was added into the molten copper and bronze was developed thereby.  Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin.  Bronze was an important advance because it had the edge-durability and stiffness that pure copper lacked.  Until the advent of iron, bronze was the most advanced metal for tools and weapons in common use (see Bronze Age for more detail).", "Outside Southwestern Asia, these same advances and materials were being discovered and used around the world. People in China and Great Britain began using bronze with little time being devoted to copper. Japanese began the use of bronze and iron almost simultaneously. In the Americas it was different.  Although the peoples of the Americas knew of metals, it was not until the European colonisation that metalworking for tools and weapons became common. Jewelry and art were the principal uses of metals in the Americas prior to European influence.", "About 2700 BCE, production of bronze was common in locales where the necessary materials could be assembled for smelting, heating, and working the metal. Iron was beginning to be smelted and began its emergence as an important metal for tools and weapons. The period that followed became known as the Iron Age.", "By the historical periods of the Pharaohs in Egypt, the Vedic Kings in India, the Tribes of Israel, and the Maya civilization in North America, among other ancient populations, precious metals began to have value attached to them. In some cases rules for ownership, distribution, and trade were created, enforced, and agreed upon by the respective peoples. By the above periods metalworkers were very skilled at creating objects of adornment, religious artifacts, and trade instruments of precious metals (non-ferrous), as well as weaponry usually of ferrous metals and/or alloys.  These skills were well executed.  The techniques were practiced by artisans, blacksmiths, atharvavedic practitioners, alchemists, and other categories of metalworkers around the globe. For example, the granulation technique was employed by numerous ancient cultures before the historic record shows people traveled to far regions to share this process.   This and many other ancient techniques are still used by metalsmiths today.", "As time progressed metal objects became more common, and ever more complex. The need to further acquire and work metals grew in importance. Skills related to extracting metal ores from the earth began to evolve, and metalsmiths became more knowledgeable. Metalsmiths became important members of society. Fates and economies of entire civilizations were greatly affected by the availability of metals and metalsmiths. The metalworker depends on the extraction of precious metals to make jewelry, build more efficient electronics, and for industrial and technological applications from construction to shipping containers to rail, and air transport. Without metals, goods and services would cease to move around the globe on the scale we know today.", "Metalworking generally is divided into three categories: forming, cutting, and joining.  Most metal cutting is done by high speed steel tools or carbide tools.[8] Each of these categories contains various processes.", "Prior to most operations, the metal must be marked out and/or measured, depending on the desired finished product.", "Marking out (also known as layout) is the process of transferring a design or pattern to a workpiece and is the first step in the handcraft of metalworking. It is performed in many industries or hobbies, although in industry, the repetition eliminates the need to mark out every individual piece. In the metal trades area, marking out consists of transferring the engineer's plan to the workpiece in preparation for the next step, machining or manufacture.", "Calipers are hand tools designed to precisely measure the distance between two points. Most calipers have two sets of flat, parallel edges used for inner or outer diameter measurements. These calipers can be accurate to within one-thousandth of an inch (25.4 \u03bcm). Different types of calipers have different mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to be measured with less precision, a tape measure is often used.", "Casting achieves a specific form by pouring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to cool, with no mechanical force. Forms of casting include:", "These forming processes modify metal or workpiece by deforming the object, that is, without removing any material. Forming is done with a system of mechanical forces and, especially for bulk metal forming, with heat.", "Plastic deformation involves using heat or pressure to make a workpiece more conductive to mechanical force. Historically, this and casting were done by blacksmiths, though today the process has been industrialized. In bulk metal forming, the workpiece is generally heated up.", "These types of forming process involve the application of mechanical force at room temperature. However, some recent developments involve the heating of dies and/or parts. Advancements in automated metalworking technology have made progressive die stamping possible which is a method that can encompass punching, coining, bending and several other ways below that modify metal at less cost while resulting in less scrap.[11]", "Cutting is a collection of processes wherein material is brought to a specified geometry by removing excess material using various kinds of tooling to leave a finished part that meets specifications.  The net result of cutting is two products, the waste or excess material, and the finished part.  In woodworking, the waste would be sawdust and excess wood.  In cutting metals the waste is chips or swarf and excess metal.", "Cutting processes fall into one of three major categories:", "Drilling a hole in a metal part is the most common example of a chip producing process.  Using an oxy-fuel cutting torch to separate a plate of steel into smaller pieces is an example of burning. Chemical milling is an example of a specialty process that removes excess material by the use of etching chemicals and masking chemicals.", "There are many technologies available to cut metal, including:", "Cutting fluid or coolant is used where there is significant friction and heat at the cutting interface between a cutter such as a drill or an end mill and the workpiece.  Coolant is generally introduced by a spray across the face of the tool and workpiece to decrease friction and temperature at the cutting tool/workpiece interface to prevent excessive tool wear. In practice there are many methods of delivering coolant.", "Milling is the complex shaping of metal or other materials by removing material to form the final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [x and y axis] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis.  It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests).  Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform a vast number of complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.", "The pieces produced are usually complex 3D objects that are converted into x, y, and z coordinates that are then fed into the CNC machine and allow it to complete the tasks required.  The milling machine can produce most parts in 3D, but some require the objects to be rotated around the x, y, or z coordinate axis (depending on the need).  Tolerances come in a variety of standards, depending on the locale. In countries still using the imperial system, this is usually in the thousandths of an inch (unit known as thou), depending on the specific machine. In many other European countries, standards following the ISO are used instead.", "In order to keep both the bit and material cool, a high temperature coolant is used.  In most cases the coolant is sprayed from a hose directly onto the bit and material.  This coolant can either be machine or user controlled, depending on the machine.", "Materials that can be milled range from aluminum to stainless steel and almost everything in between.  Each material requires a different speed on the milling tool and varies in the amount of material that can be removed in one pass of the tool.  Harder materials are usually milled at slower speeds with small amounts of material removed.  Softer materials vary, but usually are milled with a high bit speed.", "The use of a milling machine adds costs that are factored into the manufacturing process.  Each time the machine is used coolant is also used, which must be periodically added in order to prevent breaking bits.  A milling bit must also be changed as needed in order to prevent damage to the material.  Time is the biggest factor for costs.  Complex parts can require hours to complete, while very simple parts take only minutes.  This in turn varies the production time as well, as each part will require different amounts of time.", "Safety is key with these machines.  The bits are traveling at high speeds and removing pieces of usually scalding hot metal.  The advantage of having a CNC milling machine is that it protects the machine operator.", "Turning is a metal cutting process for producing a cylindrical surface with a single point tool. The workpiece is rotated on a spindle and the cutting tool is fed into it radially, axially or both. Producing surfaces perpendicular to the workpiece axis is called facing. Producing surfaces using both radial and axial feeds is called profiling.[13]", "A lathe is a machine tool which spins a block or cylinder of material so that when abrasive, cutting, or deformation tools are applied to the workpiece, it can be shaped to produce an object which has rotational symmetry about an axis of rotation. Examples of objects that can be produced on a lathe include candlestick holders, crankshafts, camshafts, and bearing mounts.", "Lathes have four main components: the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the tailstock.  The bed is a precise & very strong base which all of the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line shaft, modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The tailstock can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.", "Other operations that can be performed with a single point tool on a lathe are:[13]", "Chamfering: Cutting an angle on the corner of a cylinder.\nParting: The tool is fed radially into the workpiece to cut off the end of a part.\nThreading: A tool is fed along and across the outside or inside surface of rotating parts to produce external or internal threads.\nBoring: A single-point tool is fed linearly and parallel to the axis of rotation to create a round hole.\nDrilling: Feeding the drill into the workpiece axially.\nKnurling: Uses a tool to produce a rough surface texture on the work piece.  Frequently used to allow grip by hand on a metal part.", "Modern computer numerical control (CNC) lathes and (CNC) machining centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools. When driven tools are used the work piece stops rotating and the driven tool executes the machining operation with a rotating cutting tool.  The CNC machines use x, y, and z coordinates in order to control the turning tools and produce the product. Most modern day CNC lathes are able to produce most turned objects in 3D.", "Nearly all types of metal can be turned, although more time & specialist cutting tools are needed for harder workpieces.", "There are many threading processes including: cutting threads with a tap or die, thread milling, single-point thread cutting, thread rolling, cold root rolling and forming, and thread grinding. A tap is used to cut a female thread on the inside surface of a pre-drilled hole, while a die cuts a male thread on a preformed cylindrical rod.", "Grinding uses an abrasive process to remove material from the workpiece.  A grinding machine is a machine tool used for producing very fine finishes, making very light cuts, or high precision forms using an abrasive wheel as the cutting device. This wheel can be made up of various sizes and types of stones, diamonds or inorganic materials.", "The simplest grinder is a bench grinder or a hand-held angle grinder, for deburring parts or cutting metal with a zip-disc.", "Grinders have increased in size and complexity with advances in time and technology. From the old days of a manual toolroom grinder sharpening endmills for a production shop, to today's 30000 RPM CNC auto-loading manufacturing cell producing jet turbines, grinding processes vary greatly.", "Grinders need to be very rigid machines to produce the required finish. Some grinders are even used to produce glass scales for positioning CNC machine axis. The common rule is the machines used to produce scales be 10 times more accurate than the machines the parts are produced for.", "In the past grinders were used for finishing operations only because of limitations of tooling. Modern grinding wheel materials and the use of industrial diamonds or other man-made coatings (cubic boron nitride) on wheel forms have allowed grinders to achieve excellent results in production environments instead of being relegated to the back of the shop.", "Modern technology has advanced grinding operations to include CNC controls, high material removal rates with high precision, lending itself well to aerospace applications and high volume production runs of precision components.", "Filing is combination of grinding and saw tooth cutting using a file. Prior to the development of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces.  The skilled use of a file allowed a machinist to work to fine tolerances and was the hallmark of the craft.  Files can vary in shape, coarseness, and whether the teeth or single cut or double cut depending on what application the file is to be used for.[14] Today filing is rarely used as a production technique in industry, though it remains as a common method of deburring.", "Broaching is a machining operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.", "Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing coalescence.  This is often done by melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material that cools to become a strong joint, but sometimes pressure is used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld.", "Many different energy sources can be used for welding, including a gas flame, an electric arc, a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound.  While often an industrial process, welding can be done in many different environments, including open air, underwater and in space.  Regardless of location, however, welding remains dangerous, and precautions must be taken to avoid burns, electric shock, poisonous fumes, and overexposure to ultraviolet light.", "Brazing is a joining process in which a filler metal is melted and drawn into a capillary formed by the assembly of two or more work pieces.  The filler metal reacts metallurgically with the workpiece(s) and solidifies in the capillary, forming a strong joint.  Unlike welding, the work piece is not melted.  Brazing is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of 450\u00a0\u00b0C (842\u00a0\u00b0F).  Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because alloying elements can not segregate and precipitate.", "Brazing techniques include, flame brazing, resistance brazing, furnace brazing, diffusion brazing, inductive brazing and vacuum brazing.", "Soldering is a joining process that occurs at temperatures below 450\u00a0\u00b0C (842\u00a0\u00b0F). It is similar to brazing in the way that a filler is melted and drawn into a capillary to form a joint, although at a lower temperature. Because of this lower temperature and different alloys used as fillers, the metallurgical reaction between filler and work piece is minimal, resulting in a weaker joint.", "Riveting is one of the most ancient metalwork joining processes.[citation needed] Its use declined markedly during the second half of the 20th century,[citation needed] but it still retains important uses in industry and construction, and in artisan crafts such as jewellery, medieval armouring and metal couture in the early 21st century. The earlier use of rivets is being superseded by improvements in welding and component fabrication techniques.", "A rivet is essentially a two-headed and unthreaded bolt which holds two other pieces of metal together. Holes are drilled or punched through the two pieces of metal to be joined. The holes being aligned, a rivet is passed through the holes and permanent heads are formed onto the ends of the rivet utilizing hammers and forming dies (by either cold working or hotworking).\nRivets are commonly purchased with one head already formed.", "When it is necessary to remove rivets, one of the rivet's heads is sheared off with a cold chisel. The rivet is then driven out with a hammer and punch.", "While these processes are not primary metalworking processes, they are often performed before or after metalworking processes.", "Metals can be heat treated to alter the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion.  Common heat treatment processes include annealing, precipitation hardening, quenching, and tempering.  The annealing process softens the metal by allowing recovery of cold work and grain growth.  Quenching can be used to harden alloy steels, or in precipitation hardenable alloys, to trap dissolved solute atoms in solution.  Tempering will cause the dissolved alloying elements to precipitate, or in the case of quenched steels, improve impact strength and ductile properties.", "Often, mechanical and thermal treatments are combined in what is known as thermo-mechanical treatments for better properties and more efficient processing of materials.  These processes are common to high alloy special steels, super alloys and titanium alloys.", "Electroplating is a common surface-treatment technique. It involves bonding a thin layer of another metal such as gold, silver, chromium or zinc to the surface of the product by hydrolysis. It is used to reduce corrosion, create abrasion resistance and improve the product's aesthetic appearance. Plating can even change the properties of the original part including conductivity, heat dissipation or structural integrity. There are four main electroplating methods to ensure proper coating and cost effectiveness per product: mass plating, rack plating, continuous plating and line plating.[15]", "Thermal spraying techniques are another popular finishing option, and often have better high temperature properties than electroplated coatings due to the thicker coating. The four main thermal spray processes include electric wire arc spray, flame (oxy acetylene combustion) spray, plasma spray and high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) spray.[16]", "General:"]], "https://www.craftsglossary.com/metal-crafts/": [{"h1": ["Metal Crafts"], "h2": ["METALWORKING (METALSMITH)", "ENAMELING", "BLACKSMITHING", "FARRIER", "TINWARE \u2013 TINSMITH", "WEAPONSMITH \u2013 SWORD MAKING, ARMORER, GUNSMITH, FLETCHING", "CLOCKMAKING", "SILVERSMITH", "COPPERSMITH", "KNIFE MAKING", "LOCKSMITHING", "JEWELRY", "GOLDSMITH", "LAPIDARY", "WATCHMAKING", "PEWTER", "METAL CRAFTS \u2013 CASTING", "Primary Sidebar"], "h3": ["You May Also Love", "Search", "Recent Posts", "Other Pages You May Like"], "h4": [], "h5": [], "h6": []}, ["Crafts Glossary", "Whether you\u2019re looking for a new hobby or an expert crafter, Crafts Glossary helps you discover new types of crafts, crafting tips & more.", "Metal Crafts", "Are you trying to figure out what to make out of metal?

Some of the traditional ancient handicraft styles are Bidriware, Pembarthi Metal Craft, Dhokra, Kamrupi", "Bihar , recognised by its Madhubani/Mithila Painting, Being the birth place of some of the most celebrated folk takes of India, it comes out quite naturally that the natives of Mithila have an innate quality to conceive a visually captivating narrative art form, to tell these tales with their due reverence. These visual narratives are known as Madhubani Paintings, literally meaning the \u2018Forest of honey\u2019. These are also one of the earliest forms of Indian paintings., Bhagalpur painting which is also known as Manjusha Art & extra ordinary delicacy of quilting.[1]", "Rajasthan, recognised by its Royal heritage is a prominent and well-established craft industry. Craft remains a tradition in Rajasthan, preserved over centuries by the stronghold of the Royal Rajput family.[2]   Within the craft industry are smaller occupations. These include, fabric colouration and embellishment, decorative painting and puppetry. Craft workers see this not as an occupation, but rather a mark of respect to their heritage. In the process of fabric colouration, woven fabrics are treated by methods such as tie-dyeing, resist dyeing and direct application. The dupatta worn by women show the popularity of dyeing. In 2008, traditional Jodhpur garments inspired designer Raghavendra Rathore's collection, Rathore Jodhpur.[3] Fabric dyeing belongs to the Chippa caste of Rajasthan. Fabrics are embellished with mirror embroidery, symbolic to Rajasthan and wooden beading once dyed. The trend of mirror embroidery is also visible on dupattas in Punjab, known as the phulkari. Decorative patterns adorn all surfaces in Rajasthan. Interiors of homes are painted with floral motifs; similar bindi (dotted) designs are seen on garments. The clipped camel is unique to Rajasthan. In this, patterns are imprinted on the hide of the camel, taken place during the Pushkar and Nagaur festivals by the Rabari caste.[4]   Puppetry and theatre has remained a popular form of entertainment in Rajasthan. Recently, its popularity has reduced with increased interest in film and television amongst rural communities. The nat bhat caste produces these marionette style puppets.[5]  Facial expressions are painted on a mango wood head and the body is covered in decorative, Rajasthani clothing. The strings loosely bind the arms and torso together to give flexibility for movement. These puppets usually perform in legends and mythology conveying a moral message. The Rajasthani craft industry is iconic to the identity of India with many of its styles reaching the international market. Tie-dyeing is an example of how international fashion aesthetics have rooted from simple crafts methods of Rajasthan.", "Gujarat is renowned for its textile production methods. Bordering Rajasthan, the two states share similarities in culture and identity. The ancient Indus Valley Civilization inhabited the entire region, including Rajasthan and Punjab during Medieval India.[6] They embarked on this textile industry in Gujarat. Within textile production, each caste is assigned to an occupation of its own. These are, weaving, dyeing and printing. For example, the Salvi caste is assigned to weaving.[7] Garment producers bring these elements together to form the identity of Gujarati textiles. Direct application is a method also symbolic to Gujarati garments. Paint and other applicants are used to form patterns on fabric for dupattas, ghagras (long skirt) and turbans. Block printing is a widely used form of direct application, Gujarati Ajrakh block printing is one of the oldest printing technique, origin of Ajrakh can probably be older than we can imagine. Excavation sites of Indus Valley Civilization give evidence that Ajrakh was possibly one of the oldest printing methods of the Indian subcontinent.[8]", "In Bandhani, a unique Gujarati craft, fabric is tied at different sections before dyeing to create patterns.[9] This foundation of forming patterns through dyeing has emerged from the rural communities of this state. Along with the complete image of a Gujarati woman are large bangles made of ivory and plastic, these are symbols of a married woman. Conch shell and shellac bangles are the most common. Conch shell bangles are plain white with a light shade of a brighter colour where as shellac bangles are shaped as a shell, painted and decorated with glitter.[10]   These have in recent years become an accessory in both domestic and international markets..", "To the far eastern region of India is Assam. A state recognised for its creative use of raw materials in textiles and crafts. Assam was one of the states whose craftwork was exhibited in the National Handicrafts and Handborn Museum in 2010, showcased to first lady, Michelle Obama.[11] Production of silk fabrics is iconic of Assamese textiles. Silk is the most valued raw material of Assam, with the Antheraea assama worm producing the unique muga silk.[12] It is mostly the duty of women to construct silk fabrics, using a domestic backstrap loom.[13] Mahatma Gandhi had noted \u2018Assamese women are born weavers, they weave fairy-tales in their cloth\u2019.[13] Domestic weaving is an important craft for Assamese women, their marriage and future is seen as reliant upon this skill. At some stage, an unmarried girl would present a hand made bihuan to her beloved.[14] Weaving holds a significant moral and cultural value in Assam. The silk and textile industry is also an economic resource to the state with over 25000 families associated with this craft.[12] Cane and bamboo crafts are also unique to Assam, the result of heavy physical work. Ridang, suli, lezai and long cane are a natural resource to the state.[15] The finest cane is chopped and reduced to thin strips then woven into sheets. It is attached to the frame of a furniture piece, usually made out of bamboo sticks. They are also used as mats, providing comfort in summer.[15] The trend of this sitalpati[15] mat is also seen in Punjab in which a woven mat attached to a frame becomes a charpai. The crafts of Assam are reliant upon the raw materials of the state also making them unique.", "The diversity of religious beliefs has had a great impact on the crafts of Southern India. The region has seen the rule of various empires such as the Mughal, Portuguese, Dutch, French and British.[16]  Each has left their mark of style on traditional crafts. The craft industry of South India has established itself commercially in the nation, whilst reflecting a long history of foreign rule. Dravidian style, stone carved temples reflect the influence of Hinduism whilst Roman Catholic churches echo the impact of the British rule.[16] Temple carvings are symbolic of the craft skills in the Tamil Nadu region. The Meenakshi temple of Madurai typifies the skills and devotion put into this craftwork.", "Madurai garland making craft can be defined as a band or chain of flowers, foliage, and leaves. In Tamil Nadu, and particularly in the temple town of Madurai, flower garlands are considered to play a significant role in expressing and enhancing Tamil culture. Every garland is a myriad of colours; a kaleidoscopic journey; an array of fragrant, vivid flowers weaved together to symbolize love, purity, and devotion.[17]", "[18] Each section of the temple is a sacred shrine to a deity. North of Tamil Nadu is Karnataka, a region renowned for its wood and stone craftwork. The forests of this region provide extensive supplies of raw materials, mostly rosewood. For wood workers, crafting statues for large temples is a major source of income. The forms of characters from Hindu mythology are carefully shaped with a chisel. Soapstone is also commonly used to carve statues giving them a unique textural quality and smooth finish.[19]", "The crafts of India have been valued throughout time; their existence today proves the efforts put into their preservation. Contemporary designers such as Ritu Kumar and Ritu Virani are constantly embedding traditional crafts into their designs.  Also, there is a complete educational institute, Indian Institute of Crafts and Design (IICD) which is established in Jaipur, Rajasthan, which mainly educates for the crafts and their existence with design. Despite these efforts, the roots of these crafts, which are the rural craftsmen, are in decline. This argued by the India Foundation for the Arts organisation.[20] Rising costs of materials and supplies have placed many of these craft communities in financial struggle. A recent article in the Times of India predicts the price of steel to rise between Rs 600 and 1000 per tonne.[21] On the other hand, statistics from the All India Handicrafts Board show that craft export has risen from 230\u00a0million to over 90\u00a0billion since the past 50 years.[22] With rising economic and political issues in India, the craft sector is struggling to uphold. Although an interest to retain the culture of crafts is seen in designers and institutions.\nHandicrafts are the creative products made by the skill of the hand without the help of modern machinery and equipment. Nowadays, hand-made products are considered to be a fashion statement and an item of luxury.", "India's rich cultural heritage and centuries of evolutionary tradition is manifested by the huge variety of handicrafts made all over the country. Handicrafts are a mirror of the cultural identity of the ethnic people who make it. Through the ages, handicrafts made in India like the Kashmiri woollen carpets, Zari embroidered fabrics, terracotta and ceramic products, silk fabrics etc. have maintained their exclusiveness. In the ancient times, these handicrafts were exported to far off countries of Europe, Africa, West Asia and Far East via the \u2018silk route\u2019. The entire wealth of timeless Indian handicrafts has survived through the ages.
