Is that you NEVER know what to expect when it comes to blogging. You also can never \u201crelax\u201d because\u00a0just as you think you\u2019ve got one thing figured out, it changes. Usually for the worst (hello Instagram, I\u2019m looking at you and your dumb algorithms).", "I think it\u2019s healthy\u00a0to sit and look back at the year before and take an honest accounting of what you\u2019ve done and not done.\u00a0 It helps you to stay motivated to work going forward and can even refocus your priorities when needed.", "I will say that I think if you\u2019re going to look back to do so cautiously and objectively. I think at times it\u2019s too easy to focus on the bad going on.

Let me tell you no one I know in this industry thinks that.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to have a presence in the \u201cweb\u201d and a voice and a platform. There is the constant pressure to not make yourself out to be more than you are. To present an honest look at yourself. There is also the pressure to not fill up peoples social media feeds with complaining and negativity.\u00a0 I know that when I get the flu, or my teenagers do something stupid, that no one wants to read about that (or at least they don\u2019t want to read about it a lot).\u00a0 Personally, I have chosen to put out good into the \u201cinternet world\u201d.\u00a0 That\u2019s part of why I think I work so hard. The internet desperately needs \u201cgood\u201d things. Fun things to read on Facebook, simple projects to ignite creativity, and inspiring images to make people WANT to create something.

Before stitching, ensure any automatic backstitch or \u201cfix\u201d mechanisms on your machine are turned off; and when you start stitching, do NOT backstitch or stitch extra stitches in place, as you normally would at the start of any seam.

Sewing is one of the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era. Before the invention of spinning yarn or weaving fabric, archaeologists believe Stone Age people across Europe and Asia sewed fur and skin clothing using bone, antler or ivory needles and \"thread\" made of various animal body parts including sinew, catgut, and veins.[1][2]", "For thousands of years, all sewing was done by hand.  The invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization in the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world.[2] Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality tailoring, haute couture fashion, and custom dressmaking, and is pursued by both textile artists and hobbyists as a means of creative expression.[citation needed]", "The first known use of the word \"sewing\" was in the 14th century.[3]", "Sewing has an ancient history estimated to begin during the Paleolithic Era.[4]  Sewing was used to stitch together animal hides for clothing and for shelter. The Inuit, for example, used sinew from caribou for thread and needles made of bone;[5]  the indigenous peoples of the American Plains and Canadian Prairies used sophisticated sewing methods to assemble tipi shelters.[6] Sewing was combined with the weaving of plant leaves in Africa to create baskets, such as those made by Zulu weavers, who used thin strips of palm leaf as \"thread\" to stitch wider strips of palm leaf that had been woven into a coil.[7] The weaving of cloth from natural fibers originated in the Middle East around 4000 BC, and perhaps earlier during the Neolithic Age, and the sewing of cloth accompanied this development.[8]", "During the Middle Ages, Europeans who could afford it employed seamstresses and tailors. The vital importance of sewing was indicated by the honorific position of \"Lord Sewer\" at many European coronations from the Middle Ages. An example was Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex who was appointed Lord Sewer at the coronation of Henry VIII of England in 1509. Sewing for the most part was a woman's occupation, and most sewing before the 19th century was practical. Clothing was an expensive investment for most people, and women had an important role in extending the longevity of items of clothing. Sewing was used for mending. Clothing that was faded would be turned inside-out so that it could continue to be worn, and sometimes had to be taken apart and reassembled in order to suit this purpose. Once clothing became worn or torn, it would be taken apart and the reusable cloth sewn together into new items of clothing, made into quilts, or otherwise put to practical use. The many steps involved in making clothing from scratch (weaving, pattern making, cutting, alterations, and so forth) meant that women often bartered their expertise in a particular skill with one another.[4] Decorative needlework such as embroidery was a valued skill, and young women with the time and means would practice to build their skill in this area. From the Middle Ages to the 17th century, sewing tools such as needles, pins and pincushions were included in the trousseaus of many European brides.[9]", "Decorative embroidery was valued in many cultures worldwide. Although most embroidery stitches in the Western repertoire are traditionally British, Irish or Western European in origin, stitches originating in different cultures are known throughout the world today. Some examples are the Cretan Open Filling stitch, Romanian Couching or Oriental Couching, and the Japanese stitch.[10] The stitches associated with embroidery spread by way of the trade routes that were active during the Middle Ages. The Silk Road brought Chinese embroidery techniques to Western Asia and Eastern Europe, while techniques originating in the Middle East spread to Southern and Western Europe through Morocco and Spain.[11] European imperial settlements also spread embroidery and sewing techniques worldwide. However, there are instances of sewing techniques indigenous to cultures in distant locations from one another, where cross-cultural communication would have been historically unlikely. For example, a method of reverse appliqu\u00e9 known to areas of South America is also known to Southeast Asia.[11]", "The Industrial Revolution shifted the production of textiles from the household to the mills. In the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, the machinery produced whole cloth. The world's first sewing machine was patented in 1790 by Thomas Saint.[12] By the early 1840s, other early sewing machines began to appear. Barth\u00e9lemy Thimonnier introduced a simple sewing machine in 1841 to produce military uniforms for France's army; shortly afterward, a mob of tailors broke into Thimonnier's shop and threw the machines out of  the windows, believing the machines would put them out of work.[13]  By the 1850s, Isaac Singer developed the first sewing machines that could operate quickly and accurately and surpass the productivity of a seamstress or tailor sewing by hand.", "While much clothing was still produced at home by female members of the family, more and more ready-made clothes for the middle classes were being produced with sewing machines. Textile sweatshops full of poorly paid sewing machine operators grew into entire business districts in large cities like London and New York City. To further support the industry, piece work was done for little money by women living in slums. Needlework was one of the few occupations considered acceptable for women, but it did not pay a living wage. Women doing piece work from home often worked 14-hour days to earn enough to support themselves, sometimes by renting sewing machines that they could not afford to buy.[14]", "Tailors became associated with higher-end clothing during this period. In London, this status grew out of the dandy trend of the early 19th century, when new tailor shops were established around Savile Row.[15]  These shops acquired a reputation for sewing high-quality handmade clothing in the style of the latest British fashions, as well as more classic styles. The boutique culture of Carnaby Street was absorbed by Savile Row tailors during the late 20th century, ensuring the continued flourishing of Savile Row's businesses.", "Sewing underwent further developments during the 20th century. As sewing machines became more affordable to the working class, demand for sewing patterns grew. Women had become accustomed to seeing the latest fashions in periodicals during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, increasing demand for sewing patterns yet more. American tailor and manufacturer Ebenezer Butterick met the demand with paper patterns that could be traced and used by home sewers. The patterns, sold in small packets, became wildly popular. Several pattern companies soon established themselves. Women's magazines also carried sewing patterns, and continued to do so for much of the 20th century. This practice declined during the later decades of the 20th century, when ready-made clothing became a necessity as women joined the paid workforce in larger numbers, leaving them with less time to sew, if indeed they had an interest.[citation needed] Today, the low price of ready-made clothing in shops means that home sewing is confined largely to hobbyists in Western countries[citation needed], with the exception of cottage industries in custom dressmaking and upholstery.", "The spread of sewing machine technology to industrialized economies around the world meant the spread of Western-style sewing methods and clothing styles as well. In Japan, traditional clothing was sewn together with running  stitch that could be removed so that the clothing could be taken apart and the assorted pieces laundered separately. The tight-locked stitches made by home sewing machines, and the use of Western clothing patterns, led to a movement towards wearing Western-style clothing during the early 20th century.[16] Western sewing and clothing styles were disseminated in sub-Saharan Africa by Christian missionaries from the 1830s onward. Indigenous cultures, such as the Zulu and Tswana, were indoctrinated in the Western way of dress as a sign of conversion to Christianity.[17] First Western hand sewing techniques, and later machine sewing, spread throughout the regions where the European colonists settled. However, a recent examination of new online learning methods demonstrated that technology can be adapted to share knowledge of a culture's traditional sewing methods. Using self-paced online tutorials, a Malay sewing class learned how to tailor and sew a traditional men's Baju Kurung garment in 3 days, whereas a traditional Malay sewing class would have taken 5 days to teach the same information.[18]", "Advances in industrial technology, such as the development of synthetic fibres during the early 20th century, have brought profound changes to the textile industry as a whole. Textile industries in Western countries have declined sharply as textile companies compete for cheaper labour in other parts of the world. According to the U.S. Department of Labor \"employment of sewers and tailors is expected to experience little or no change, growing 1 percent from 2010 to 2020\".[19][20] It is estimated that every lost textile job in a Western country in recent years has resulted in 1.5 jobs being created in an outsourced country such as China.[21] Textile workers who perform tasks with sewing machines, or do detailed work by hand, are still a vital component of the industry, however. Small-scale sewing is also an economic standby in many developing countries, where many people, both male and female, are self-employed sewers.", "Garment construction is usually guided by a pattern. A pattern can be quite simple; some patterns are nothing more than a mathematical formula that the sewer calculates based on the intended wearer's measurements. Once calculated, the sewer has the measurements needed to cut the cloth and sew the garment together. At the other end of the spectrum are haute couture fashion designs. When a couture garment is made of unusual material, or has extreme proportions, the design may challenge the sewer's engineering knowledge. Complex designs are drafted and refitted dozens of times, may take around 40 hours to develop a final pattern, and require 60 hours of cutting and sewing. It is important for a pattern to be created well because the way a completed piece fits is the reason it will either be worn or not.[22]", "Most clothing today is mass-produced, and conforms to standard sizing, based on body measurements that are intended to fit the greatest proportion of the population. However, while \"standard\" sizing is generally a useful guideline, it is little more than that, because there is no industry standard that is \"both widely accepted and strictly adhered to in all markets\".[23]", "Home sewers often work from  patterns purchased from companies such as Simplicity, Butterick, McCall's, Vogue, and many others. Such patterns are typically printed on large pieces of tissue paper; a sewer may simply cut out the required pattern pieces for use but may choose to transfer the pattern onto a thicker paper if repeated use is desired. A sewer may choose to alter a pattern to make it more accurately fit the intended wearer. Patterns may be changed to increase or decrease length; to add or remove fullness; to adjust the position of the waistline, shoulder line, or any other seam, or a variety of other adjustments.[24] Volume can be added with elements such as pleats, or reduced with the use of darts. Before work is started on the final garment, test garments may be made, sometimes referred to as muslins.", "Sewers working on a simple project need only a few sewing tools, such as measuring tape, needle, thread, cloth, and sewing shears. More complex projects may only need a few more simple tools to get the job done, but there are an ever-growing variety of helpful sewing aids available.", "In addition to sewing shears, rotary cutters may be used for cutting fabric, usually used with a cutting mat to protect other surfaces from being damaged. Seam rippers are used to remove mistaken stitches. Special marking pens and chalk are used to mark the fabric as a guide to construction.[25]", "Pressing and ironing are an essential part of many sewing projects, and require additional tools. A steam iron is used to press seams and garments, and a variety of pressing aids such as a seam roll or tailor's ham are used to aid in shaping a garment. A pressing cloth may be used to protect the fabric from damage.[25]", "Sewing machines are now made for a broad range of specialised sewing purposes, such as quilting machines, heavy-duty machines for sewing thicker fabrics (such as leather), computerized machines for embroidery, and sergers for finishing raw edges of fabric.[26]", "A wide variety of presser foot attachments are available for many sewing machines\u2014feet exist to help with hemming, pintucks, attaching cording, assembling patchwork, quilting, and a variety of other functions.[27]", "A thimble is a small hard tool used as a protective device for sewing.", "Seamstresses are provided with the pattern, with the intent of using as little fabric as possible. Patterns will specify whether to cut on the grain or the bias to manipulate fabric stretch. Special placement may be required for directional, striped, or plaid fabrics.[28]", "Supporting materials, such as interfacing, interlining, or lining, may be used in garment construction, to give the fabric a more rigid or durable shape.", "Before or after the pattern pieces are cut, it is often necessary to mark the pieces to provide a guide during the sewing process. Marking methods may include using pens, pencils, or chalk, tailor's tacks, snips, pins, or thread tracing, among others.[29]", "In addition to the normal lockstitch, construction stitches include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching.[30] Seam types include the plain seam, zigzag seam, flat fell seam, French seam and many others.[31]", "With the development of cloth simulation software such as CLO3D, Marvelous Designer and Optitex, seamsters can now draft patterns on the computer and visualize clothing designs by using the pattern creation tools and virtual sewing machines within these cloth simulation programs.[32]", ""]], "https://depositphotos.com/198567454/stock-video-woman-working-sewing-project-she.html": [{"h1": ["A woman working on a sewing project as she cuts fabric and sews it on a machine. sewing machine close up A hand of a dressmaker supporting a cloth while sewing on a machine. \u2014 Stock Footage"], "h2": ["Special Offer", "Similar Royalty-free Videos:", "Same Series:", "Usage Information", "Clip Keywords:", "Buy Stock Footages from Categories:"], "h3": [], "h4": [""], "h5": ["Depositphotos", "Language", "Information", "Contact & Support", "Follow Us"], "h6": []}, ["A woman working on a sewing project as she cuts fabric and sews it on a machine. sewing machine close up A hand of a dressmaker supporting a cloth while sewing on a machine.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Video by Shipe1", "Video \"A woman working on a sewing project as she cuts fabric and sews it on a machine. sewing machine close up A hand of a dressmaker supporting a cloth while sewing on a machine.\" can be used for personal and commercial purposes according to the conditions of the purchased Royalty-free license.

More basic trims, such as bias tape, piping, cording, or small beads and ribbons can be easily applied with your sewing machine, maybe with the aid of a specific presser foot, but usually even that is more for convenience and extra precision rather than strict necessity.

Polyester thread has a small amount of \u2018give\u2019 and is therefore suitable for use with stretch and knit fabrics.

When working with Gutermann threads be\u00a0sure you pick up\u00a0the right thread when shopping, this is distinguished by the colour at the end of the spool. The Sew All 100% Polyester thread has a cream or white end (100m \u2013 cream, 250m, 500m and 1000m \u2013 white).", "When should I use cotton thread?\nCotton thread is the perfect accompaniment\u00a0to 100% cotton fabric and\u00a0is therefore most commonly\u00a0used in patchwork and quilting. Some\u00a0sewing purists believe that you should use the same thread as the\u00a0fabric yarn content, so cotton thread should be used to sew cotton fabric.", "Cotton thread has very little \u2018give\u2019 and is weaker than other available threads, such as polyester. But it can be perfect for use on lightweight, delicate projects\u00a0as generally speaking you want the thread to be weaker\u00a0than the fabric your working with, so any stress on seams causes the thread to break, rather than the fabric to tear.", "I personally don\u2019t get much use from cotton thread simply because I\u00a0don\u2019t have a large variety of colours to hand.

I predominately use silk thread when hand sewing; finishing hems, basting (tacking), buttonholes and tailoring work. Silk thread is very smooth so travels through even the lightest most delicate fabrics without leaving a mark, as well as being very strong (especially when used in conjunction with beeswax), it is a superb choice for a large variety of hand sewing projects.", "Other uses include decorative stitching. On the sewing machine I use silk thread on the top spool\u00a0when quilting Chanel style jackets. The thread is wonderful at sinking into the textured loose weave.", "Uses for topstitching thread?\nTopstitching thread is as the name suggests suitable for topstitching. Although standard thread can be used for topstitching the thicker topstitching thread is perfect for use on heavier weight fabrics and provides a decorative look to stitching.", "When completing topstitching be sure to work with topstitching thread on the top of the sewing machine and a normal bobbin. You will require a topstitching needle so that the eye of the needle is large enough for the thread to pass through. Try increasing your stitch length to get a better finish; generally speaking the thicker the fabric the larger the stitch length required (the standard stitch length of 2-2.5mm will disappear in thick fabrics such as denim and canvas).", "When to use extra strong thread?\nAlthough extra strong thread is not suitable for the majority of every day sewing projects it does it have uses. Especially when working with home furnishing projects. The thread is constructed as a thicker, stronger polyester thread that can take a great deal of wear and tear. It is perfect for use on denim, leather and canvas fabrics as well as rugged repair work.", "TIP: It is possible to use\u00a0extra strong\u00a0thread for topstitching\u00a0if you don\u2019t have a suitable topstitching colour to hand.", "Sewing with decorative threads (metallic & embroidery)?\nMetallic and embroidery threads are fabulous for machine or hand embroidery, creating decorative detailing\u00a0on garments and home decor projects.

This is exactly what you\u00a0don't\u00a0want in your finished sewing project. Before you start marking out patterns or cutting into your fabric, make sure to wash and dry it according to the care instructions. This will remove any starch or sizing, remove excess dye, and pre-shrink all those shrinkable fibers.", "Read your entire pattern", "No one likes to be caught off guard, especially when you're in the middle of a sewing project. Before you start in on a new project, make sure to familiarize yourself with the whole process of cutting and assembling the project. This includes looking over your pattern pieces so you understand how everything fits together and any alterations you may need to make.", "Take careful measurements", "For sewists who work with wearables, this is probably number one on every list of tips and tricks you've ever read. But it's just as important for sewists who work with other projects as well! Imagine designing a new clutch purse, only to realize it's too small to hold a cell phone, or stitching new drapes which hang just a little too short. No matter what kind of project you're planning, make sure it's just the right size.", "Slow down", "Sometimes, you just want to crank through your sewing and get the project done. Of course, sometimes deadlines don't let you work at a leisurely pace, but whenever you can, remember that slow and steady wins the race\u2014if by race, you mean creating perfectly finished sewing projects!", "This tip is especially important if you're working on a new design or using techniques you haven't before. Save your pricey fashion fabrics or beautiful quilting prints for the finished version, and use inexpensive or scrap fabric as a stand in to practice your techniques. Make sure to use a stand in that closely matches the important features of your actual material, though. No use practicing with cotton muslin if your finished garment is going to be made with a knit material.", "Keep your equipment in good shape", "Get in the habit of regularly cleaning and tuning up your sewing machine. A few minutes every few weeks can save you lots of time and trouble later on. Go through your pins and needles and (safely!) discard anything that's bent or showing rust. Get your serger tuned up by a technician to keep everything running smoothly, and take your scissors in to be professionally sharpened. Even the very basics shouldn't be neglected, like washing the cover of your ironing board.", "Keeping all your pattern pieces, equipment, and techniques straight can get tricky. If you have to work on more than one project at a time\u2014like if you're stocking up for a craft show, for example\u2014, try to make it the same\u00a0kind\u00a0of project. In fact, if you're planning to make lots of things from the same pattern, it's a good idea to work on them one after another rather than switching between project types.", "Sewing while multitasking is a bit like texting and driving. It's ill-advised, and for very good reasons. Never operate a sewing machine while distracted. It's not a car, but it can still cause pretty severe injuries. Of course, lots of people do enjoy working on hand sewing while doing something else, like watching a movie, listening to music, or enjoying an audiobook. This is fine for tasks you're very familiar with, but if you're trying something new, even something basic like learning a new embroidery stitch, take the time to focus and concentrate to make sure you're doing everything correctly.", "Think you'll remember exactly where that notch is? How much were you supposed to gather again? All those little pattern marks are more than helpful suggestions. It's easy to skip over them, but your projects will suffer for it. Make sure to include any adjustments and alterations, and always mark both your stitch lines and seam allowances\u2014 lining up the edges of your fabric won't always give you the desired result.", "It's easy to get so absorbed in your work that you completely forget how much time has passed. Until, that is, you make a mistake. Now you've got even more work undoing the errors, or repairing or replacing damaged pieces. Save yourself a lot of time and trouble. Set aside your project at regular intervals to stand up, stretch, and refocus. If you have a hard time remembering to do this, set a timer.
