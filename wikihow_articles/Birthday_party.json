{"How to Plan a Birthday Party": {"description": "Planning birthday parties is both fun and stressful. There are many elements of a good party to take into consideration, and the responsibility of the party being a blast falls on you. There are some fail-safe steps to take in order to plan a fantastic birthday party that will have everyone involved and having fun. Make sure thatyouhave fun along the way!", "content": {"Deciding When and Where to Have the Birthday Party": [" Choose a date for the birthday party. The sooner you choose a date, the sooner you can get started with planning other elements of the party. Consult with the person whose birthday it is to determine a good day for the party. Check their schedule and take note of any holidays around that time. Keep in mind that many people travel for different holidays. It is advisable to host the party on a weekend. More people will be willing and able to come if it is on a weekend, because many people do not have to work on the weekends.    ", " Select a time for the party. Appropriate times will vary based on who the party is for and the age of that person. If you are throwing a birthday party for a child, host it in the late morning or early afternoon. This is most convenient for families. If you are throwing a party for an adult, then an evening party is appropriate.  ", " Decide on a budget for the party. Parties can easily consume a great deal of money, so it is important to come up with a budget and stick to it.  Come up with an overall budget, meaning a total amount that you want to spend on the birthday party. Most people believe that a budget up to \u00a3200-300 is reasonable, and many feel keeping party costs under \u00a3150 is completely doable.  Break down each element of the party (e.g. invitations, food, drink, decorations, venue) and decide how much should be spent in each area.  ", " Create a guest list for the party. There are a few reasons for doing this. A guest list will help you ensure that no one is forgotten when sending out invitations. It will aid you in deciding where to hold the party. A guest list of 12 people means you could host the party in someone's home, if you wanted to do so, but a guest list of 50 people will likely need to be held somewhere else. This will eliminate the risk of people the birthday person does not want attending showing up to the party. Having a number of guests in mind enables you to determine how much food and drink will need to be provided, if you are doing that yourself or having it catered.  ", " Consider where to have the party. This involves knowing the individual for whom the party is being thrown. Take into consideration what the birthday person wants. If he/she wants a more elaborate party, then work to plan the party in a venue that enables that. If he/she is into small gatherings with close friends, then aim for that instead. You will need to decide if you want to have the party in your home or someone else's home in order to keep the venue cost-free. Think about making a reservation at a restaurant if your party is of a reasonable size. Most restaurants can accommodate up to about 25 people without too much issue. Another idea is to host the party at a party or banquet hall. This will be a more expensive option, but it can easily accommodate more people. Think about the guest list and keep in mind if any guests need accommodations. Be sure that wherever you choose caters to people who need certain accommodations, like wheelchairs.  "], "Planning Out the Party Details": [" Decide if the party should have a theme. Themed birthday parties can be a lot of fun, but they can also end up being more costly when you consider buying everything to match the theme.  Weigh the pros and cons of having a themed party based on the person whose birthday it is. Would they like a themed birthday party? Consider whether it is a kid's party or an adult's party. Choose a theme that is age-appropriate, if you decide to go this route. For example, appropriate themes for children would be based on kid-friendly television shows or movies, circus, movie theater, a children's book, or carnival. On the other hand, appropriate themes for adults might be a black-and-white affair, casino, a decade theme, or an adult movie or television show.  ", " Purchase and send out invitations. Once the earlier details are decided upon, then it is time to send out invitations to the guest list. It is best to send out the invitations about 3-4 weeks in advance of the party in order to give people enough time to plan for it. Be sure to include RSVP information on the invitation. Sending out the invitations after you have decided on the earlier details ensures that you have the guest list secured and that you have decided on whether to have a themed party, making you more organized. Be sure to reach out to some of the invited guests for help. They can help set up, clean up, provide food, decorate, and more. It is not necessary to do it all by yourself!   ", " Create a plan for the food and beverages. Based on what you have decided for the party, you have different options for these aspects. Decide what type of food will be best for the party. If you chose a theme, then make sure the food flows with that theme. For example, a would work great for an army-themed party, but it would seem out of place for a princess-themed party. Know whether any of your guests have food allergies. If so, be sure to provide options that are safe for them to eat or let them know that they are welcome to bring their own food. Be realistic about how much food and drink to provide based on the length of the party. A party that is planned to be an hour or two might only require refreshments and birthday desserts, while a party that is meant to last for several hours will need more of a meal.  Make sure that you plan for enough food and drink to cater to all of the guests. Err on the side of too much food rather than too little.  ", " Know your obligations for providing the food and drinks. You may or may not be responsible for providing these things, based on your decision about where to host the party. If you are throwing the party in your home or someone else's, decide if you will make all of the food yourself. If not, then reach out to others and ask for their assistance in providing the food and drinks. A potluck is a great idea! If the party is going to be held at a restaurant, then no real planning needs to be done in this area, as the restaurant will take care of that for you! If the party is going to be at a party or banquet hall, then you need to check with their staff about catering options. Find out if you can bring the food, if they will cater the food, or if they have particular vendors they use to cater food for parties. Decide whether alcohol should be provided, if it is an adult birthday party. For example, if the birthday person does not drink and has many friends and family who do not drink, then alcohol would be unnecessary.   ", " Gather decorations for the party. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of the planning! If you decided on a theme for the party, then this will be easy, as you will simply buy decorations to match the theme. If you did not decide on a theme, then think about what the birthday person would want. Does he/she like a lot of decorations, like balloons, streamers, and confetti? Or is he/she more of a laid-back person who is not interested in decorations? Purchase decorations accordingly. Decorations are not as important for an adult's birthday party, but they are quite important for a child's birthday party. Kids are imaginative, so even household items can contribute to the decorations if you want to save money in this area.   ", " Choose entertainment options for the birthday party. This could involve several different types of entertainment. For a child's birthday party, there are many options. Games are great, but they often require supplies, so keep that in mind. You could have a story time, if it goes with the theme. Another idea is to have music playing. You could also hire an entertainer, such as a clown, a magician, or a scientist, if it is in your budget.  An adult's party can just as easily include games. It would also be helpful to have music playing in the background, either via a disc jockey or via a homemade setup with a computer or smartphone and speakers. If the party is going to be out on the town, then the entertainment could come in the form of a live band or an activity, such as a comedy show.  ", " Choose what dessert will be. For many birthday parties, this is the most important part! Most of the time, the birthday person will want a cake, especially if it is a child. Decide whether you are going to make the cake yourself or purchase one from a bakery. Know what kind of cake the birthday person likes, and take into consideration any food allergies of the guests. Have an alternative dessert ready if they cannot have the cake. If the birthday person does not want a cake, then provide what they do want! Cupcakes, brownies, pies, cookies, and ice cream are all perfectly acceptable substitutions for birthday cake.  ", " Create a back-up plan in case of weather, especially if the party is outside. Have an alternative location prepared and a system for notifying the guests if the need arises. "], "Getting Ready for the Party": [" Arrange your organized help to assist you in setting up the party on the day of. This is why you asked them to help, so make sure they are there to help you! Set up the decorations and food, if necessary. If you are providing the food to the party venue, then be sure to get it to the venue on time. Give yourself enough time to set everything up. Rushing will result in mistakes. Have everything you need in one place, or have dedicated helpers be in charge of what supplies they are helping to provide. Know where everything is to streamline the process.  ", " Have a plan for keeping the food hot or cold, depending on what it needs.  If the food is being catered or provided by the restaurant, then that will be taken care of by that business. If you are providing the food in your home or someone else's, then be wary of putting the food out too early. Food can spoil if it is not kept hot or cold.  ", " Notify your guests if you have to move the party to the back-up location. If you had an outdoor party planned and the weather is poor, then your guests need to know where to go instead. ", " Be prepared for mishaps, because they most likely happen. Take them in stride as best you can. Have a dedicated cool-down area if a child gets upset during the party. It is best if it is away from the rest of the guests. Have a first aid kit and anything else that you think might be necessary in case someone gets injured during the party. If you have pets, keep them secured away from the guests for the duration of the party. Unless your pets are very well behaved and trained, an issue could arise there, from someone being afraid of them to the pets getting loose.  "]}}, "How to Host a Birthday Party": {"description": "Hosting a birthday party, whether for a child, teen or adult, requires more than just showing up and smiling, though both are certainly required. It involves laying the foundation for a successful party by determining the type of party you\u2019re going to throw and planning the details, such as the food, drinks, entertainment and decorations. It also involves knowing proper party-hosting etiquette, which starts with the invitations and ends with the \"thank you\" cards, so your guests leave happy and excited to attend your next party.", "content": {"Deciding Party Type and Style": [" Create a budget and stick to it. Knowing how much money you have to work with will help determine the location of the party and how much you can afford to spend on entertainment, food, drinks, decorations, party favors and supplies. Without a budget, you run the risk of overspending and not enjoying the party, both of which you certainly want to avoid. To help create your budget, use free spending tools that can be found at Manilla.com, apps such as Party Budget Tracker, or go to evite.com/app/party/calculator for help. With teen parties, be prepared and budget for friends of friends to attend.   ", " Decide upon a location, date and time. Choose a location that the guest of honor would most enjoy or feel most comfortable being at. This might be at your home, another\u2019s home or a place in the community, such as a restaurant, country club, bar, park, gymnasium, etc. If you\u2019re thinking about hosting it at your home, ask yourself if you\u2019re prepared for the responsibility that entails, particularly if it\u2019s a children\u2019s birthday party. An entire first-grade class running around your two-bedroom bungalow is a lot to handle! After you\u2019ve chosen the location, decide on a date and time after confirming that it will work with (a) the location, if it\u2019s not at your home; and (b) any special invitees. If it\u2019s a children\u2019s party, keep it short. Two or three hours is plenty of time, especially for younger children, and plan toddler parties in the morning when they\u2019ll be in better spirits.  ", " Pick a theme for the party. Children\u2019s parties typically have themes, and the invitations you send will relate to this theme. You\u2019ll need to decide on the theme first, and involve your child in picking a theme for his or her birthday party. If it\u2019s an adult birthday party, a theme is also appropriate and even desirable. Attending a party as an adult often requires getting a babysitter, buying a new outfit, booking a car and so forth. Incorporating a fun theme is a great way to entice people to come to the party, and it's a conversation starter once people arrive.   ", " Create the guest list and sent out invitations. The guest list will be determined in large part by how many people your location and budget can accommodate. Make sure to determine these things before writing down names. After you\u2019ve written the guest list, check with the guest of honor to make sure you haven\u2019t left off anyone he or she particularly wants there. The next step is to send out the invitations, whether paper or digital, at least three to four weeks in advance. Here are a few more tips on both guest lists and invitations. If it\u2019s a children\u2019s party, don\u2019t exclude just one person from a whole group (boy scout troop, class, soccer team, etc.) just because he or she isn\u2019t your child\u2019s friend. If you\u2019re inviting just part of his or her class, don\u2019t hand out invitations at school. If it's a teen's party, specify an ending time an hour earlier than you actually expect everyone to leave to account for dawdling, and ensure you get parents' contact information with the RSVP. Include all necessary information in the invitation, including things such as style of dress and the level of formality. Include a GPS-friendly address as well. Use websites such as Evite.com or Punchbowl.com to send customized electronic invitations. Add photos and be creative with your wording to build excitement for the party. Follow up with phone calls to those who haven\u2019t RSVP\u2019d a few days before the party.  "], "Preparing for the Party": [" Enlist help if needed. Ask friends, your spouse, relatives, other parents, older children and so forth for help with such things as supervision, photography and games. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with this, and it\u2019s within your budget, hire a professional, a high-school student or your babysitter to help with the pre- or post-party cleaning, or to help during the party by serving food, supervising children and teens, or whatever you might need to assist you. ", " Make a master list of supplies. Your list of supplies will depend largely on the location and type of party, but one is necessary all the same. Outside of food and drinks, possible supplies include things such as balloons, party hats, signs, games, crafts, music, coolers, serving dishes, tablecloths, plates, cups, ice, extra toilet paper and utensils. ", " Decide on entertainment. The entertainment will depend largely on the type of party, its theme and the location, but it's very important to keep those at the party engaged so put extra thought and effort into planning it. With children\u2019s parties, it\u2019s best to create a schedule of activities and intersperse higher- and lower-energy activities.  If you\u2019re hiring entertainment for any type of party, make sure you book early and ask about set-up requirements. If you plan to have the party at your home and to play music, create your mood-appropriate playlists in advance. Make sure you include the guest of honor\u2019s favorites, too.  ", " Plan the food or menu. Depending on where you\u2019re hosting the party, you may or may not make the food yourself. In fact, if your budget allows it, you could have the food catered at any location. What\u2019s most important is that the food is appropriate for the people who are in attendance, while also keeping the theme in mind. Even if it\u2019s a children\u2019s party, don\u2019t forget the parents who may stay and make sure you have something for them to snack on and drink, too. Here are a few more tips. For children\u2019s parties, finger foods, pizza and things most children actually like to eat are best. Keep it simple. For teen parties, keep it simple as well, but make sure you have a lot. Pizza, chips, pretzels and soda are all good and don't require utensils (more trash). Always have a few extra goody bags in case an unexpected guest attends or one is lost. If you\u2019re having it at your home and cooking yourself, pre-cook and pre-assemble the day before, if possible, so you don\u2019t feel so rushed the day of and have more time with guests. Assign seats at large dinner parties, splitting up couples and seating more quiet people by more lively people to generate a more festive party. Don\u2019t forget the birthday cake, even if it\u2019s a party for an adult, and make sure you order it in plenty of time! If you arrange for the food to be catered, you\u2019ll also want to ensure that it's ordered about three weeks in advance.   ", " Decide on drinks. With children\u2019s and teens' parties, make sure you have more than you think you may need because they'll likely go through a lot. Avoid pumping younger children full of caffeinated beverages, which their parents will thank you for later. For adult parties, make sure you include non-alcoholic beverages, and label big-batch cocktails or punches to indicate that they contain alcohol. Always have more cups than you think you will need. You don't want to run to the store in the middle of the party.  ", " Get your supplies. A week or two before the party, go shopping and get everything you\u2019ll need for the party. Some things, like fresh foods, will need to wait. But it\u2019s best to have everything else well in advance so if you need to have something ordered, you\u2019ll have time to make the order. Balloons, streamers, and party activities can wait as well. ", " Clean and decorate. If you\u2019re having the party at your house, you\u2019ll want to clean thoroughly inside and do any major yard work or planting if the party is outside. Removing knickknacks and clutter and rearranging furniture will help free up space for guests to move about more easily. It also creates a more welcoming environment.  After the cleaning or if you\u2019re having the party at another location, you\u2019ll want to decorate based on the party\u2019s theme. Don\u2019t spend a lot of money, time or energy on decorations that most won\u2019t even notice, though.  ", " Do the final prepping. Get the cameras ready. Stash extra toilet paper in the bathrooms. Light candles. Turn on the music. Set up the food. Strategically place trash cans. "], "Hosting the Big Day": [" Dress for the occasion. The last thing you want is to be in a chic outfit that\u2019s completely unsuited to chasing after children for two or three hours. Nor do you want to wear stilettos that may make your legs look fabulous but your feet ache an hour into your hosting duties. Choose your attire wisely so that you look nice and well put together, but also with a mind to being comfortable so that you\u2019re not a cranky host or hostess.  ", " Give yourself time to settle before the party. Try to have everything in place at least 30 minutes before the party starts. That includes yourself. This will allow you to catch a breath and be more relaxed when you welcome guests and be more prepared in case guests arrive early. Doing this will set the tone for the rest of the party, and it will be a good tone. If you\u2019re running behind and a guest arrives early, greet the person nicely and explain you\u2019re behind schedule. Asking the guest to help with something can help alleviate the awkwardness. If it\u2019s a dinner party at your home, have appetizers and drinks out and ready for guests when they arrive.  ", " Greet guests warmly. You should greet each guest as he or she arrives, hopefully by name. As the host or hostess of the party, it\u2019s your responsibility to make them feel welcome, to make them feel you\u2019re happy they are there. Offer to take their coats; show them around if you\u2019re able to; either receive the gift or explain where to put it; say thank you for the gift; and explain the plans for the party, if applicable. Have a craft or non-competitive game or activity at children\u2019s parties for newcomers until everyone arrives.  ", " Mingle with guests. As the host or hostess of the party, it\u2019s your job to make everyone feel comfortable during the party. Talk with your guests; genuinely listen to what they\u2019re saying; respond authentically; ask them questions; introduce guests to those they don\u2019t know; and so forth. Don\u2019t wait for others to generate the party\u2019s energy. You get it going, help it sustain itself from that point forward, and enjoy yourself while doing so! The more you put others at ease, the better the party will be.  ", " Stay calm when things go wrong. Drinks will be spilled. Plates will start to pile up. The music might suddenly stop. Focus on guests, not cleanup or problems. Problems can be resolved, often much more easily than we may initially think. When accidents happen, as they will, accept apologies with a smile and take care of them.  Have stain remover on hand and create discreet places to put garbage and dirty dishes.  You can deal with those things after the party, or hire help to assist during it. At children\u2019s parties, have plenty of paper towels on hand and keep your sense of humor about you!  ", " Attend to guests throughout the party. Always offer guests refreshments throughout the party. If you see someone with an empty cup, offer to refill it. If you see someone standing alone, go speak with that person or introduce him/her to someone you think they might enjoy getting to know. At children\u2019s parties, don\u2019t rush activities that are going well to stay on schedule. Just go with the flow for a little while until it\u2019s really time to move on. Monitor teens as best you can throughout the party. If you see suspicious activity, talk with the teen in private and, if necessary, call the teen's parent.  ", " Avoid drinking too much alcohol. If it\u2019s an adult party, you shouldn\u2019t drink too much as the host or hostess of the party. Getting drunk or even a bit too tipsy can make your guests feel uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t lend itself well to fulfilling your hosting duties. ", " Don\u2019t use your phone unless absolutely necessary. Although it\u2019s a seemingly regular occurrence for people to be glued to their phones, even at parties, it\u2019s best to keep your phone put away while hosting a party. If a situation exists in which you need to keep your phone on vibrate and then must take a call, excuse yourself politely to take the call, keep it brief and return to your guests promptly to explain why you had to answer the call. Being upfront and only using the phone when absolutely necessary is reasonable, and your guests will be understanding.  ", " Open gifts at children\u2019s parties. Typically, gifts are opened at children\u2019s birthday parties because most children love to see what the guest of honor received. The child who gave the gift also likes to see the guest of honor open that gift. This is usually one of the last things done at the party, and the host will want to write down what present each child gave so that information can be noted in the thank you card. Gifts can be opened at adult and teen birthday parties as well, though this is not generally the standard.  ", " Thank guests for coming to the party. At the end of the party, the host or hostess should personally thank each guest for attending and tell the guests goodbye. The host or hostess should also thank the guests again for bringing a gift, if they did. If it\u2019s a child\u2019s birthday party, use this as a time to teach good manners and encourage your child to personally thank friends for attending and for their gifts. At teen parties, call the parent if someone isn't picked up on time or says he or she is taking an alternate means home. Goody bags are typically given at this time. Although these are generally reserved for children\u2019s and teens' parties, they can also be given at adult parties. Here are some ideas for adult party favors: Make a small potted plant with moss, cacti or a houseplant and wrap a ribbon around it. Create your own wine labels and adhere them to wine bottles using double-sided tape. Mix up your own BBQ herb rub, put it in a glass jar and attach the recipe to it. Buy small notebooks from a dollar store, write down the recipes from the foods you served and tie a ribbon around each. Have photos printed during the party and insert them in frames to give before guests leave.   ", " Send thank you cards. About a week after the party, send a thank you card to each guest who attended, expressing your appreciation. Personalizing each note is a nice touch and goes a long way. Make sure to mention the particular gift that was given. If you have a photo from the party that includes the person and guest of honor or one of the whole group, include that photo as well.

No matter what you wear, be comfy and true to your style!", "content": {"Crafting a Casual Look": [" Wear fitted jeans and a playful top for daytime parties. You want to be comfortable and wear a style that's true to you, but you also want to show that it's a special occasion. So take your everyday wear and add a special touch to bring it up a notch. For example, spruce up your casual jeans with a sequined tank top and a fluorescent clutch. Or, wear an interesting neckline (like a henley shirt) with fitted jeans and patterned sneakers.  Add a cropped jacket or patterned scarf to look great in cool weather.    ", " Wear a maxi or midi dress with sandals for outdoor daytime parties. If the party is going to be mostly outdoors, flowy dresses with playful patterns are perfect for daytime fun. If the print is bold, accessorize with minimalist pieces. For solid-color dresses, feel free to wear a few minimal pieces of jewelry or a single statement piece. A chunky necklace is a great way to show off your d\u00e9colletage. Pair a single-colored maxi or midi dress with colorful shoes or a patterned jacket. Transition the outfit to nighttime by belting the waist, putting on heels, and donning a long, fitted cardigan for cool nights.

Show off your shoulders with a fun off-the-shoulder top, and top it off with a small statement clutch and some booties. Choose appropriate clothing that isn't too flashy or sexy. Remember, the party isn't about you and how good you look, it's about the person whose birthday it is!  ", " Wear a blazer over a button-down with tailored shorts or jeans. A nice, fitted blazer will make any pair of shorts or jeans look sophisticated, especially if you do a \u201cFrench tuck.\u201d Finish the look with a pair of nice loafers, sneakers, or flats. For women, transition the look to nighttime with a pair of low to mid heels or wedges. For men, turn it into a nighttime look by changing into a pair of slacks, chinos, or dark wash denim.   ", " Pair a cardigan with a graphic tee and fitted jeans for day or night. Layering a cardigan or blazer over a comfy tee looks more polished than the t-shirt alone. Just make sure the t-shirt isn't too loose or long to avoid looking unkempt. Leave the shirt untucked for an ultra-casual look and tuck it in slightly to show off a nice belt buckle.  ", " Wear a maxi or midi dress to pool parties. If you're going to a pool party, you might want to wear something you can get in and out of easily (like a maxi dress or thin shirt and shorts that you don't care about getting damp). Wear comfortable sandals or flip flops to match the laid-back poolside vibes. If the party is both indoors and outdoors, dress for the weather and bring layers.  ", " Wear a comfy shirt with shorts or simple jeans to children's parties. Most children's parties are ultra-casual, so your everyday wear will work just fine here. There's probably going to be lots of activities going on, so you'll want to be comfortable and able to move around quickly (especially with younger children in attendance). Avoid wearing white jeans or a white shirt so you they won't get stained from spills or grass.  Wear cargo pants or shorts for pocket space if you might need to hide small objects that aren't safe for younger children and toddlers. If you're a parent, bring a large bag for snacks, water, sunscreen, and anything else you or your child might need.

Pair a knee-length (or just above the knee) dress with cork wedge heels or low heels for comfort and style. Wedges are a good choice if you know that you'll be walking on grass.  ", " Pair a flashy skirt with a simple fitted blouse and low heels. A flashy sequin skirt goes perfectly with a simple (tucked in) top will make a statement without looking overdone. Top it with a cropped denim or leather jacket for cooler weather. The louder the outfit, the simpler your accessories should be. Let the sequins be the focal point and accessorize with a simple gold or silver necklace or bracelet. Turn it into a nighttime look by wearing strappy heels and adding a small clutch.  ", " Wear a cocktail dress or tailored suit for fancy nighttime parties. If the birthday party is at night and taking place in a fancy restaurant or upscale lounge, that's the time to break out those cocktail dresses, tailored suits, and dress shoes! Aim to look sharp and sophisticated with a spoonful of glamour and drama. Opt for a dress that sits right at the knee. If you go shorter, make sure that it has a medium or high neckline so you're not revealing too much skin. Go bold and dramatic with darker colors and structured, romantic shapes (like an off-the-shoulder neckline). A tailored suit is always a great choice for men (lighter colors for daytime and darker for nighttime) with a nice pair of loafers or dress shoes. A tie is optional so long as you wear a collared button-down. Steer clear of any loud patterns unless it's just a pop here and there (like on a pocket square).   ", " Accessorize to complement your outfit. Accessories can complement your style and highlight your best features. But too many accessories can look cluttered and distracting, so be tasteful and remember: less is more! A simple bangle or bracelet will call attention to your wrists, while an understated gold or silver necklace can highlight your d\u00e9colletage. For men, a puffed pocket square and a nice watch can make any simple suit look posh. If you're wearing a solid color, accessorize with a single statement piece (like a necklace, bracelet, or earrings). With bold patterns, keep accessories small and to a minimum. Keep your silver jewelry looking polished by soaking it in baking soda and hot water in a bowl lined with aluminum foil.  Men should choose a pocket square that's a shade lighter or darker than the main color of the suit to make it stand out. And don't match it directly to your tie (if you're wearing one). Instead, choose a secondary color from your shirt or blazer to match it to.   "], "Matching a Theme": [" Go thrift shopping for retro themes. If you have the time and don't mind spending a little money on a themed outfit, thrift stores are a great resource to find clothes that could fit various decades. For 1950s, look for pastels and waist-high skirts with a little retro bell shape. If the theme is 1970s, opt for high-waisted jeans (with flared legs), paisley patterns, psychedelic prints, ponchos, and clunky platform shoes.  Whether you're familiar with the theme or not, doing some research will spark your creativity. Look through your wardrobe for items that might fit the theme. Even if you don't have clothing that directly matches, combining mismatched pieces and layering them can do wonders!  ", " Wear pastels for an \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d theme. Say the theme is \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d but you don't have any flowy looking garments. You can wear a pastel shirt, leggings of any color, and a pastel colored skirt over it with a colorful scarf tied around your waist. You won't exactly look like a mermaid, but the color scheme will allude to that idea! ", " Wear denim-on-denim for a late 90s look. Take a tip from celebrity fashion, like wearing head-to-toe denim to channel a late 1990s celebrity-darling look. Combine different washes of denim to make it look more fashionable and highlight your best assets. Pair this look with statement heels or a long blazer to glam it up.  A small headband can be worn as a 90s choker.   ", " Cut up an old skirt to make a cape or toga. Old clothes you don't wear anymore are perfect for costumes because you can cut and shape them to fit various themes. For example, that old maxi skirt you no longer wear can be cut open down the side and fashioned into a cape or draped like a toga. ", " Use tin foil or bubble wrap for intergalactic or campy 80s glam themes. Tin foil and bubble wrap can be a creative way to make normal clothes look interstellar for an outer-space-themed party or 80s shin-dig! It won't necessarily look fashionable, but it will show off your creativity and sense of humor. Cut rounded triangular pieces of foil and safety pin them to an old jacket to make shiny shoulderpads. Tape bubble wrap around your arms, legs, or torso for a spacesuit or alien look.  ", " Rip the sleeves off of old shirts and sweaters for various themes. Simply tearing the sleeves off of sweaters and shirts can work with tons of themes. Look like a Breakfast Clubber by tearing long sleeves off of sweaters or jersey shirts at the shoulder seam. Rip some holes in the front and back in it to make it ultra-grunge or punk. Save your ripped shirts and sweaters for a great zombie-apocalypse Halloween costume! Drape a studded belt diagonally across your torso (like a messenger bag strap) to accessorize a punk or grunge theme.  ", " Use jean scraps to make counterculture patches. Cut old jeans into shorts and then cut the pant legs into small squares to make patches you can safety-pin on a shirt or jacket for a counterculture look. To fray the edges of the shorts, comb and tease out the fibers from the freshly cut edges.  If you want to scuff up the jeans to look worn in, rub the outside of the jeans down the side of a cheese grater. Make sure you don't want to wear the clothing (as is) anymore before you cut into it!

The best time for a baby\u2019s or toddler\u2019s birthday is on a weekend afternoon. The parents are generally available for a couple of hours and the invited kids (birthday honoree included) can nap before or after. Choose a day that\u2019s a 2-3 weeks out to give the parents advanced notice. Have a start and end time, say 1-3 pm. This way no one shows up too late and they don\u2019t feel pressure to stage an awkward exit at some point in the day; there will be an actual group exodus 2 hours later. This makes it easy on the child \u2018\u2019and\u2019\u2019 easy on the parents. It\u2019s no pressure and convenient, so they\u2019ll be more likely to come. This is also a good amount of time to fit into everyone's schedules.   ", " Choose your guests wisely. This is one of the only times in your child\u2019s life where the guests are going to very different people of mixed ages. They\u2019ll be friends, neighbors, family members, and children close to your child\u2019s age, though not necessarily the same. Think about how many people you can handle being the host. Generally speaking, a good number is around 10. The more ages and types you bring, the more you\u2019ll have to be accommodating. If other young children are present, they\u2019ll need entertaining. You\u2019ll need \"adult food\" and \"child food,\" too. Think about what each person would need when you\u2019re compiling your list.  ", " Pick your invite platform. You\u2019ll need to send out invites for the guests either via snail mail, email, or phone call. Having something tangible is best \u2013 a text or a phone call is easily forgettable. There are a few websites like Evite that can set up \u201cpersonalized\u201d invitations for you, too.  The main benefit of snail mail is that you can make it truly your own. If you go this route, consider adding a personal touch with your baby\u2019s handprint on the invite. That\u2019s one for the scrapbook! However, you\u2019ll likely want to send out a phone call or a text 3-5 days before the party to make sure everyone has remembered the event and to gather RSVPs.  ", " Give guests a clue on what you\u2019d like for gifts. Many parents don\u2019t want more toys for their children. If you want something specific for gifts, be direct on the invitation. Indicate whether you want practical items, money or gift cards, or nothing at all. It\u2019s not impolite \u2013 it\u2019s saving them the hassle of buying something you don\u2019t actually want. However, stay away from demanding gifts that are too expensive, or demanding them in the first place. If they're watching their wallets, they'll be less likely to come if gifts are mandatory.

Cater to their ages \u2013 have some \u201cadult\u201d food and some \u201ckid-friendly\u201d food. You don\u2019t need to plan a meal; just have snacks available throughout the party. You can make a boxed cake seem like bakery-made heaven with the addition of mayonnaise or an extra egg. No need to spend a ton of money on a professional cake for a birthday your child will not likely remember. And this way you can get all the credit for the delicious dessert.

Show them you appreciate them coming with a goody bag, even if it\u2019s just for the kids. If it\u2019s not for the adults, they\u2019ll still be glad they came as their kids have something to keep them occupied. It\u2019s more to show them your appreciation and to make it a day for everyone.  ", " Prep your toddler. If your child is old enough to understand, let them know what\u2019s going to happen. A bunch of people are coming over to celebrate Presents! But it also means that other kids might see their stuff, that their routine will be interrupted, etc. If they understand what\u2019s happening, they may stay calmer. Let them know that this is a day of fun \u2013 it shouldn't be stressful or scary. Most of the time will be spent playing games, opening presents, and eating food.  ", " If the kids are old enough, plan a few games. Having a bunch of 3-year-olds running around for 2 hours will not be the best birthday party for the books (especially according to the other parents). To be sure they stay at least semi-occupied, plan a few games for them (this also lets the parents enjoy themselves). Need some ideas? Start out with a craft, keeping the kids entertained with coloring, paper, glitter, and whatever else you have around the house. Then move onto musical hot potato, freeze dancing, or a non-competitive round of musical chairs.   "], "Throwing a Kid Birthday Party": [" Plan a theme. Going to a restaurant or to a bowling alley is great, but your kid might go ga-ga over a themed birthday party \u2013 and you could even have that theme at the bowling alley anyway. It makes it easier to pick out decorations, design the cake, and choose activities. Talk to your child about what they\u2019d like \u2013 it should come down to their preferences. If your child has pretty outlandish taste (\u201cI want a hashtag theme, mom!\u201d), take him or her to the party supply store with you. Show them the options and let them pick from there.  ", " Pick a guest list with your child. Now that your child is growing up, the guest list should be a collaborative effort. Cap it at around 7 or so other children, depending on how many other parents will be available (you don\u2019t want to be left supervising 20 children on your own). Sit down with your birthday-er and pick out who they really, really want at their party. Make sure invitations get handed out covertly. If only certain friends are getting invited, it should be handled with care so the other kids don\u2019t get upset. You can either deliver them yourself, ask a teacher to hand them out with other items, or have your child do it covertly (if you think they can handle it).  ", " Organize a few activities. If kids are left to their own version of fun, you're going to enter the room finding spaghetti on the walls, chairs broken, and someone crying in the corner. Organize a few activities to keep everyone happy and the chaos to a minimum. Games with music, face painting, or craft making are trusty standards. A warm up activity is good, too. That way as the kids trickle in, the early-birds are content having something to do.  ", " Keep the food simple. Kids are easily impressed. If you can whip up a bunch of mini corn dogs, their tummies will be smiling. Have a few healthier snacks (pretzels, a veggie plate), in addition to some candy and finger foods, like chips and salsa. The time of the party will determine the food. If it's just in the afternoon, you'll only need snacks. During a meal? Try ordering pizza or getting take-out. What's the most important part? The cake, of course.  "], "Throwing a Teen Birthday Party": [" Talk your teen about what they\u2019d like, where, and when. Now that your child is old enough, they should have a big say in their party. Do they want it at home or out? What do they want to do? Do they want it during the day or at night? If they have a bunch of ideas, narrow it down for them to 3 or so that you've preapproved \u2013 they can then pick which one they want from there. Talk about a budget and scheduling constraints. You'll have to be the voice of reason in this conversation. Be honest and let them know what's doable and what's not.  ", " Plan out the guest list. Ask your teen to come up with \"the short list\" \u2013 8 or so people they want at their party. Ultimately the party should be determined by where it is (if it's somewhere else, that's less work for you) and how long it's going to last. 8 people out for pizza is manageable, but you'll only want to take 3 or 4 to the amusement park. You're finally at an age where it matters who gets invited \u2013 some people may not get along or not want to do certain things. Talk to your teen about what the people they're inviting are like, if they know each other, and any problems they foresee. Consider doing it elsewhere, like at a restaurant, trampoline park, bowling alley or arcade. Your teen likely wants freedom, and it's easier on you, too.  ", " Make sure the invites get sent out appropriately. Teens are at an age where feelings can get hurt. If your teen is inviting some kids at school and not others, find a way to make it so the invites are sent out discreetly. If they're not, it might start unnecessary drama that could dampen the event. If possible, send them via email. Ask for RSVPs so you know who is coming and can have a head count. Have your teen send reminder texts or phone calls, too, before the big day.  ", " Consider having a theme. Theme parties are fun for 4-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and everyone in between (though the themes change over time). Talk to your teen about having a theme \u2013 the kids can then dress up, you'll have fun planning out themed food, and it'll make it easier to decorate and find matching additions. This should be your teen's decision. As long as it's appropriate and doable, it should be a go. If you don't like it, give your teen a good reason why and offer alternatives.  ", " Provide all the fixin\u2019s for your party. This is especially important if you're having the party at home: plan and arrange all the food and decorate till the cows come home . With a theme it'll be easier to pick out; if you don't have one, it's up to you. Here's a few things to keep in mind: Keep the snacks coming; worry less about the main food. You can always whip up spaghetti or order pizza, depending on what the party-goers feel like. But don't forget the cake! To keep the mess better for you, buy plastic plates, forks, knives, and cups to keep the after-party clean-up to a minimum. Don't be nervous to ask other parents to bring along a few dishes if the party is at your house. A few bags of chips or some liters of soda is an easy way they can chip in.  ", " Keep a watchful eye, but allow them their fun. You need to be there to problem-solve and diffuse any tension, but when things are going well, allow them their space and their fun. They're at an age where they can take care of themselves. Be as far away as you feel is appropriate. Odds are your teen will need you to order the pizza or take care of any mess they create. While it may not be in the way you want, you'll likely be needed to stay relatively near.  "], "Throwing an Adult Birthday Party": [" Plan the who, what, when, and where. An adult birthday party can be anything from a few people gathering for drinks to a room full of people rocking out to live music. It all comes down to the preferences of the birthday honoree. Simple and classy or totally outrageous? Having it at home is easiest, but that means cleaning, cooking, entertaining, and cleaning some more. However, having it at home is cheaper and you have free reign of your territory. If you do have it at home, consider having everyone bring a dish or a drink. This keeps the burden off you and makes it a more interactive affair. If you're going out, make a reservation as soon as possible. Some places are hard to get into on a moment's notice.  ", " Send out the invites well beforehand. Unlike kids, adults have a million and one things going on that they have to attend to. To get all your guests to come, send out invites well in advance, about 2 - 3 weeks. This way they can write down the party in their calendar before the slot fills up. Send something concrete, like an email. A phone call or text is easy to forget and often doesn't seem official. But don't hesitate to send a reminder text a few days before the party.  ", " Choose a theme or over-arching activity. There are a couple of things that can make any party monumental: Pick a theme, where your guests can dress up, eat special foods, and take part in themed activities. This could be anything \u2013 from an 80s theme with neon colors and bad movies, to golf with faits and mini-golf set up in the basement, to a cartoon character theme, where you get to relive your childhood. Plan an event. It could be a photo scavenger hunt throughout the city, a pub crawl, or a macaroni and cheese tasting at your house (where everyone brings a different variation). This adds extra excitement about your party and keeps people from being bored, too. Consider entertainment like live music or a sports game. With this route, all the planning is done for you.  ", " Cover all the food and drink necessities. If you're having the party at your house, make sure everyone's well taken care of. You'll need hors d'oeuvres for people to munch on all night long, and food to accommodate everyone's allergies and diets. Some gluten-free and vegetarian plates may be a good idea. What's more, you'll likely want alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks available. For those that don't drink, keep it fun by making a punch or some other concoction that makes them feel like they're a part of it, too.  ", " Decorate the area according to your theme. Did you choose \"Old Hollywood\" as your theme? Get some old film reels, some black and white decorations, and roll out the red carpet on your sidewalk. \"90s\"? Bust out the scrunchies, the high-waisted jeans, the bright colors, and blast some Spice Girls. The limit is only your imagination \u2013 and your budget. Don't have a theme? No problem. For that macaroni and cheese party, set up a large board for everyone to vote on or make them personalized voting cards. Make name tags and decorate the table to make the mac n' cheese look better than it already does.  ", " Keep everyone mingling. Since you're likely the glue that holds this party together, try your best to work in and out of circles, introducing them to one another, and starting games if the atmosphere calls for it. Keep them safe, too. If drinking is involved, take their keys and put them in a safe place. When they go to leave, make sure they're sober before they drive away.

You could instruct the guests to dress as characters from the film.  Keep in mind that you'll also need to plan food, decorations, and activities around the theme. So if you're throwing a luau-themed party, try to throw the party at the beach or set up tropical decorations. Serve tiki drinks and set out leis for the guests.   ", " Choose the party location. You can host the party almost anywhere. The location should be large enough to accommodate all of the guests. So if you want a big surprise party, you might want to rent a community hall. But if you're throwing a surprise party with a dozen people, you could easily have it at a nice restaurant.  For example, you can have the party at the honoree's house, at your place, at a restaurant, at a park, or anywhere you think your guest of honor wouldn't expect. If you'll be renting a space, learn about what sound systems are available and ask about their policies on food and decor.  ", " Pick a date and time for the party. While you can throw the surprise party on the honoree's birthday, you might surprise them even more if you throw it a day or two in advance. You'll need to choose a time and date that works for most of the guests and you'll need to ensure that the honoree is also available.  Consider asking the honoree if they want to get together to hang out at the time you're thinking of planning the party. If they tell you they have other plans, you'll need to reschedule the party. Avoid throwing the surprise party after the person's actual birthday or they might think you forgot their big day.  ", " Decide what refreshments to serve. People expect food and drinks at a party. If you're doing a surprise party for kids, you can serve standard birthday party treats (such as punch, cookies, and cupcakes). For an adult birthday party, serve foods that are easy to prepare and eat. If you don't want to spend time on the food, consider having food catered or have the party at a restaurant.  Match the foods to the time of the party. For example, if you're having the surprise birthday party right after work on a weekday, most guests will expect a meal.

You can use this theme for any birthday, but it works especially well for first birthdays and other milestone birthdays like turning 16, 30, or 40. Go with banners, balloons, and party favors that announce the person\u2019s age and make sure that the age number appears prominently throughout the d\u00e9cor. For example, for a first birthday, the d\u00e9cor and party favors can feature the number \u201c1\u201d or say \u201cHappy 1st Birthday!\u201d on them. The cake and Mylar balloons can be shaped like the number \u201c1,\u201d as well. You can also base color choices on the age. For example, a Sweet 16 party can be decorated in shades of pink.

For example, a summer birthday party can have a tropical color scheme and feature beach themed decorations. If the party is in the fall, you could have a burgundy, brown, and orange color scheme and use autumn-themed decorations featuring leaves, pumpkins, cornucopias, and pinecones.  The season can also dictate activities for the party. For example, you can have pumpkin carving or pumpkin painting activities at a kids\u2019 autumn-themed party. Bobbing for apples is another fun idea for fall!  ", " Feature a favorite animal, sports team, or other interest in the d\u00e9cor. You probably know the person well enough to pinpoint one of their favorite hobbies or interests, but if you aren't that close to them, don't be afraid to ask someone who would know! Finding decorations that match a very specific or obscure interest may not be feasible at your local craft store, so try looking online instead. For example, a child who loves unicorns might love a unicorn-themed party with unicorn imagery and pastel decorations. If the person loves Harry Potter or Star Wars, you could go with decorations that reflect those interests.

Transform the party space by creating an atmosphere based on a location. Depending on what you choose, this may be the  most work-intensive choice, but if you have plenty of time for planning and have a creative streak, consider making a big splash with this approach. Go with a location or atmosphere that you know the person really loves! For example, create a carnival-themed party with brightly colored or striped d\u00e9cor, carousel imagery, tents, clowns, and lollipops.

", " Use garlands to emphasize the party theme or spell out messages. For something simple, string together cardboard letters to spell out a simple birthday message or the person's name. You could also create themed garlands using paper or cardboard cutouts. For example, use flower-shaped cutouts for a garden party, a string of cardboard crown cutouts for a royal-themed party, or T-rex cutouts for a dinosaur-themed party.  String together photos to create a very personal garland.  For an 80s themed dance party, string together paper cutouts of boomboxes and stereo speakers.  ", " Liven up the space with colorful balloons for a classic look. You can find balloons in a wide variety of colors, shapes, and materials at most party stores and they're a classic go-to for creating a festive atmosphere. Balloon solutions can be simple or elaborate, depending on what you want to do and how much time you have. For example, for an easy option, blow the balloons up yourself with an air pump and scatter them around the room or tape them to objects. You can also rent a helium tank, fill the balloons, and either tie them to objects in the room or simply let them float along the ceiling. For a quick option, go with Mylar balloons in different shapes and colors and have the party store fill them with helium for you. Go all out by creating a balloon arch.  ", " Create and hang a photo-collage for a personalized solution. Go with images of the birthday person at different ages and doing a variety of things to create a sentimental vibe. Images that include their friends and family members are also a great idea, especially those that you know will be in attendance at the party. You may want to print the images from digital files to prevent original photographs from getting damaged, though. For example, you could include pictures from their very first birthday party, a summer vacation, and dancing at prom. You can also create the collage as a keepsake and include blank space for the party goers to write birthday messages and well-wishes.  ", " Spread out tablecloths in eye-catching colors or prints for a quick solution. You don't have to cover your tables, but it's usually a good idea if you're renting a space. You can keep things simple and go with plastic, solid-colored table coverings that match the party\u2019s color scheme. You can also use on-theme printed tablecloths, like galaxy prints for an outer space theme or colorful stripes for a carnival theme.  You can buy printed tablecloths for almost any theme you can imagine, or you can make them yourself using butcher paper, printed images, and glue. For a ruffled look, buy several tablecloths in a few different sizes and layer them on each table. Collage printed photographs on craft paper to make a customized, personal print!  ", " Scatter confetti in fun shapes on the tabletops for a quick solution. If you need to create a festive look in a hurry, scatter colorful confetti across the tables. You can use plain confetti, or go with an on-theme solution like star-shaped confetti for an outer space theme.  Scattering glitter or sequins on the tables can create a similar effect and may even work better if you\u2019re doing a disco or carnival theme.  "], "Using Decorations at Outdoor Venues": [" Bring or rent your own tables and chairs. Most outdoor places like playgrounds and parks won't have enough seating to comfortably accommodate the number of guests you're expecting. Make sure you provide enough table space to accommodate everyone!  You may want to have a small, separate table for the gifts and larger tables where guests can eat or chat with one another. Simple folding chairs are a great option for outdoor seating. They can be purchased fairly cheaply, but you may want to rent if you're expecting a crowd.  ", " Use balloons to guide guests to the party area. Fill colorful balloons with helium, then tie the balloons to objects along the way to create a path from the parking area to the outdoor party area. Helium balloons are very light, so you can safely tie them to almost anything! If the party is in a backyard, a balloon path eliminates the need to answer the front door\u2014guests can just walk right up to the party area! You can also post colorful signs that have arrows and messages like, \"Party this way!\" Emphasize the party color scheme when choosing balloons.  ", " Drape string lights between and around trees to illuminate the area. If the party is in your backyard or at another location where electricity is accessible, this is a great solution\u2014especially if you expect the party to continue into the night. If you have trees that are fairly close together, drape the lights between them. You can also wrap the lights around tree trunks and thread them through the foliage. Buy colored lights to match the party's theme or go with white lights for a classic look. You can also find delicate fairy lights that come with battery packs if you don't have access to electricity. Attach lightweight Chinese paper lanterns to the string in between the lights to create even more ambiance.  ", " Cover the tables with craft paper for a homemade vibe. Tape a large piece of white craft paper or construction paper onto the tabletops and scatter crayons and markers across the surfaces so that party goers can write messages and draw pictures. This works great for children\u2019s parties and the covers can be easily saved as a keepsake.  Taping the paper down will prevent it from being blown away by the wind.  ", " Hang up a pi\u00f1ata for a simple, fun solution. A big, colorful pi\u00f1ata feels festive and is a great decoration for outdoor parties. You can buy pi\u00f1atas already filled with goodies, or you get an empty one that you can fill with customized treats. Choose a shape that matches your party theme or go with whatever catches your eye!  Find a sturdy tree branch to hang the pi\u00f1ata from and make sure there's plenty of space for the guests to swing at it safely!

Thirteenth birthdays can be a bit tricky to plan. Do you go for lots of games, or something a bit more grown-up to herald the start of the teenage years? Everyone will have their own ideas about what makes a good party. But as long as everyone has fun, the possibilities are endless.", "content": {"Assessing your Options": [" Brainstorm some ideas with friends. The first thing you need to do is come up with some ideas for how you might want to celebrate your birthday. It\u2019s a good idea to get together with a couple of your closest friends and try to brainstorm some possibilities. They know you well, and will be able to tell you if you have a really bad idea and offer some suggestions if you\u2019re drawing a blank.  Remember you want to do something that you like, but if you going to be with a group of friends, you want everyone to have fun.   ", " Run your ideas by your parents. Once you\u2019ve come up with a few ideas, and before you get too excited, run them by your parents. They are going to be doing a fair bit of the organising and will know more than you about the costs and limitations. They might disappoint you by not seeming too enthusiastic about an enormous expensive party, but be understanding and work together with them. They really do want you to have fun! Don\u2019t be rude and demanding to your parents, that definitely won\u2019t help with the party organization.  ", " Decide if you are going to party at home or go somewhere else. After getting some ideas with friends and talking to you parents, the first big decision is whether you are going to do something at home, or go out somewhere for the day. Each of these have their advantages and disadvantages, so it\u2019s really about what you think would be fun and what you can organise with friends and family. If the party is at your house, decide where is going to be off limits. Your parents won't want a bunch of teens trekking through their bedroom.  ", " Decide how many people you want to come. The next step is to decide how many people you want to come to celebrate your birthday. You might want to keep it small with just close friends and family, or have a big party with your whole class. What works best will depend on what kind of party you are going to have, but it\u2019s a good idea to have a rough idea of numbers before you get too far ahead in the planning. If you are keeping it small, be aware that word will travel around your class.  Try not to get into an awkward situation where you are inviting everyone from your class apart from one or two people.  Do you want it to be co-ed (girls and boys), all girls, or all boys? Talk it over with your parents and make sure that they approve your final decision.  ", " Choose a date. You'll want to pick a perfect date to have your 13th birthday party on. Ideally, it should be around your real birthday, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Try to have your birthday party on a weekend, or at least on a Friday night. You could also hold it on a day where you don't have school. Be careful if your birthday is during summer, spring, or winter break, as some of your friends may be on vacation. It\u2019s a good idea to check if another friend is having a party around the same time as you. You don't want to have your friends torn between going to your birthday or another person's birthday if they're on the same night.  ", " Pick a theme or activity. Now you have a good idea of the size, the date, and whether you are having your party at home or out, you can think about what theme you would like. There are almost endless possibilities here, so talk it over with friends and family and try to come up with something that will be really fun and is a bit special. A theme is a good way to tie the party together. Here are just a few ideas: Rollerskating party  (at your home pool or a community pool) Retro party (from the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc.) Theme party ( , , etc.)  (at home or at a professional spa) A movie party (watch a movie at the theatre or at your house) A camp-out (in the wilderness or your backyard) Game show theme (American Idol, Survivor, Amazing Race, America's Next Top Model, etc.) Go to an amusement park Go horseback riding with friends Have a (at your house or a community center) Have a  Go to a concert  "], "Making the First Arrangements": [" Book your venue. Your venue is where you will host the party. If you have decided to have a party away from home you need to book somewhere sooner rather than later to avoid disappointment. Bear in mind how many people you are inviting and make sure you are booking somewhere with enough space. Think about if you need space for dancing, and a space to put your stereo or DJ. Having a party at a specialist place can be easier to organise and handle for your parents than having one at home.   ", " If necessary, get the tickets to the event. For some places, like an amusement park or a sports game, you will need to buy tickets. It is easiest and quickest to do this in advance, you don't want to spend ages queueing. It\u2019s best to leave this stuff to the parents to sort out, but make sure you know what is going on and your friends know if they need to get their own tickets separately. Sometimes you can get group tickets at a discount. If you going to a sports game make sure you get seats together.  ", " Arrange transport. Once you know where and when you are going, you need to think about how everybody is going to get there and back again. Maybe you will all get a mini-bus from your house, or carpool. Again, this is something your parents will organise with your friends\u2019 parents, but make sure everybody understands what the plans are, including you. ", " Send out the invitations . Once the plans are well-advanced you can go ahead and send out the invitations. This is a chance for you to be a bit creative and show how much you want to share your birthday with your friends, as well as set the scene for your party. You can either write out the invitations by hand, email them out to your guests, or tell them in person or by calling them. You could also use free services on the internet that create invitations, such as Evite . It\u2019s a good idea to ask people on the invitations to let you know if they are allergic to anything. It wouldn't be good if there was an allergic reaction at your party! Don\u2019t forget to ask people to RSVP, and confirm whether or not they can come. This will be helpful in your planning. It will make arranging food, transport, entertainment, and anything, much easier if you know how many people are coming.  Give all the information and the venue, date and transport on the invitations.  "], "Make the Final Party Arrangements": [" Get the food. Plan what you are going to need food-wise. You don't want a bunch of hungry 13 year old teens turning up to a party with no food. Chips, candy, pretzels, pop, juice, fruit, and chocolate work great for finger food. You can also have little appetizers such as sausage rolls or buffalo wings. If you're going to have your guests stay for a real meal (lunch or dinner), either order in some pizza, sushi, or Chinese food, or go out to a restaurant. Be sure you take into account any dietary needs of your guests. You can tie the food into your theme. Don't forget the cake!  ", " Decorate your venue.  Decorating your party space isn't essential. It's more important if you're having a theme party, but it's always nice to have some little decorations, even if it's only a couple balloons. You\u2019re decorations will depend on your venue. Decorate as little or as much as you want (and as much as you can take financially). It\u2019s great to have decorations that go with your theme. If you are having your party at an outside venue they will most likely take care of all the decorations before you arrive.  ", " Get some entertainment. Games and entertainment can be tricky at a 13th birthday, as you might not want to play the kind of games you liked when you were younger. Be sure to talk to your parents, so you all know what kind of entertainment you and your friends would like. You can keep it simple and provide some music, or maybe a movie, depending on what kind of party you're having. You could also hire some live performers/dancers to really get the party started.

Plus, by the end of the day when all the kids' energy has come to a halt, and they fall asleep, you're right there, laying next to them, taking a little nap yourself!", "content": {"Planning Party Basics": [" Pick a theme with your child. Though it may seem unnecessary, having a theme will help you know what decorations to buy, what food to prepare, and what games to plan. Character parties are popular (think Sponge Bob or Scooby-Doo ), but general themes work, too (pirates, fairies, princesses, cowboys, etc.). Unless they want something that just isn't appropriate, allow them creative freedom. Sit down with your child at the table with a pen and paper and write down all the ideas you both like.  Some themes will obviously be more difficult than others. Go with your child to a couple of party stores and see what's available or go online. It'll be easiest to pick a theme based on what you have at your disposal. Most parents aren't Martha Stewart; you certainly don't have to be.   ", " Nail down the specifics. There are a few questions you'll have to address: When is the party going to be? How long will it last? Where is it going to be? Is there anything going on communally or culturally that would prevent other children from coming? What time of day works into your schedule?  Take your child's age into account. Generally, the younger the child, the earlier the party. You do not have to entertain all day--a few hours is more than sufficient. If you're not having it at home, consult the desired venue to see what times are available.  ", " Get invitations (that match the theme! ). Once you have them picked out, it's time to finalize the details. Check your schedule to make sure there are no girl scouts or work meetings during the time you're thinking. On the invitation, put the start and end times, address, what each child should bring (swimsuit, etc.) and if there will be a meal so parents can plan accordingly.  As for guests, a good rule of thumb is the child's age plus 1. And if parents can come along, great! It's best to have a couple others to help with monitoring and clean up. Have your invitations in the theme of your party. The other children will probably get excited, too. Your child can hand them out at school (if possible to do it discreetly) or you can give them to the parents if your child is too young (or forgetful!).  Your child shouldn't hand them out in front of those not invited -- it might make the others feel bad. Give them to the teacher to put in the take home folder or have your child put them in desks or lockers.  ", " Buy decorations. For everything from table cloths to pinatas, a party store is your best bet -- or else you'll end up bouncing around town for days looking to piece it all together. And if they don't have a specific something, ask! They may be able to order it for you.  It's always an option to make your own if you're DIY handy. And your child can always help if you want someone to blame the poor penmanship on! As an alternative idea, a few children can come over a bit earlier to make decorations themselves, if they'd like.  "], "Organizing Activities & What to Eat": [" Plan some games. These are the building blocks of a good child's party, so start thinking up craft projects, look into renting an entertainer, or utilize the facilities at an outside venue. Look in your phone book or online for party rentals or places near you. For younger kids, have a loose schedule to keep things running.  Don't be afraid to go super theme-oriented. If you're having a Wild West party, have them pan for gold in the sandbox. Conduct a scavenger hunt with theme-related clues and a final prize. Don't be afraid to go super simple. Nowadays, kids aren't playing the old school games they could be. Instead of having them all plop down in front of the Wii, have them Capture the Flag, play Red Rover, Blind Man's Bluff, or have relay races. For older children, have more free time. The older the child, the less structured the party should be. Kids will likely want to do their own thing at one point or another. If they express this, don't stress. More free time for you and the other parents!  ", " Make party favors interactive. Instead of giving them a bag of small toys that will get played with for three minutes and then shoved in a drawer, have them make the party favors themselves! The kids will feel more involved and like they were a part of the party.  They could make potato print t-shirts, simple masks, jewelry, fishing rods, badges -- the list goes on and on and on. This requires a bit more forethought, but will pay off in the long run.  You could have this be the first activity -- so children that come earlier have something to busy themselves with while the others slowly file in. Any late arriving child can take the necessary materials home with them if they'd like. Let the kids take home the decorations. This is an easy and quick idea if you have something with a general theme, like princesses or baseball. And it allows for minimal clean up!  ", " Plan the party food. When it comes to parties, one thing is timeless: cake. Will you bake one or buy one? Or two?! Cupcakes are easy and super trendy as well. Whatever you choose, either get the order in early or go grocery shopping for the ingredients ahead of time. Make the food theme oriented, too!  Despite what logic dictates, cake isn't enough. You'll need food too -- make it easy on yourself and get some pizzas delivered or get a fast food restaurant or catering company to take care of everything. Finger sandwiches and lunch bags with sandwiches and fruit, or cookies are great choices, too. If it's a nice day outside and you have a grill, kids love hot dogs and hamburgers. Don't forget the buns, mustard, and ketchup! If there will be other parents or adults attending and watching over the kids, have food for them, too. They may not be so keen on chicken nuggets and Sprite.  ", " Plan the party drinks. Soda pop, lemonade, and juice are all pretty standard. And if you'll be outside a lot, a cooler filled with bottles of water or cans of soda will surely be appreciated, especially if it's hot outside. And, of course, milk goes great with cake. If it's autumn or winter, have the kids play outside and come in for cider to warm them up.  Have glasses (and cutlery in general) that are safe for the kids to use. Things may get broken -- so don't break out your fine china. Be prepared for a mess.  ", " Plan the goodbye. Give the other parents your cell phone number on the off chance they're running late, early, or sending someone else to pick up their child. Establish protocol for the safety of every child.  As the child leaves, take note. Have them say goodbye to everyone, gather their things, their party favor, and mentally check them off their list.

For example, if you are planning a party in January and live in Michigan, you must consider the possibility of snowy or bitingly cold weather. It may not be the best decision to bring a senior citizen out in nasty weather conditions as they are more susceptible to catching illnesses. Be prepared to change plans if the honoree is unwell on the date of the party. It would not be wise to have a 90-year-old attend a party if he or she was under the weather.

Cooking your own food can be a wonderful way to pay tribute to your guest of honor, or simply to treat him or her with their favorite foods. Cooking your own party food can also be a subtle way to deal with any dietary issues that your guest of honor may have, without having to deal with them publicly at a restaurant. If your guest of honor loved to cook, serving an old family recipe can bring back good memories and create meaningful conversation. If your honoree comes from a certain cultural background, making food that can serve of a reminder of a homeland, possibly one not visited in a while, may be appreciated.

Ask her if she would like a new outfit or new shoes for the party, and make it a point to take her on a special shopping trip before the day of the party. If the honoree is a man, consider taking him to get a shave or a haircut before the party. Ask him if he would like new clothing, a new hat, or a new belt for the party.

Choose a day that appears \"typical\" to the guest of honor, and instruct your guests to casually file in one by one. Watch your honoree glow with shock as they see the number of their loved ones arriving to honor them.  ", " Use silly string or water guns. If you are planning an outdoor event, surprise the honoree by showering them with items like silly string, or water from water guns or water balloons. If you are choosing the water option, make sure the party is water-themed so that the guest will dress appropriately; either have on a swimsuit or have a change of clothes handy.  Consider your honoree's reaction before taking this route. Some people will not be happy about getting their clothes wet or having their hair covered with silly string.  ", " Make sure your party is in progress, when the guest of honor arrives. Begin serving food and drinks ahead of time. This will help detract from some of the spotlight and ease the honoree into the party more easily.

Invite people who make you feel great, set up some fun decorations, and enjoy a day that's all about you!", "content": {"Figuring out the Details": [" Create your guest list first. By estimating your number of guests before you make any other plans, you'll be able to make decisions about the other elements of the party, including the venue, food, and drinks. Start planning your guest list as soon as you decide to throw yourself a birthday party. If you expect 5 guests, for instance, you'll have very different plans than a party with 50 guests.   ", " Choose a venue that's in your budget and the right size for your guests. Birthday parties are extremely flexible \u2014 you can meet up with a few friends in the park or you can host a formal event at a local restaurant. Think about the amount of money you have available to spend, how many guests you expect to attend, and the overall feel you're going for.  If you want to have a casual, intimate celebration with a few close friends, host your party at your house. That way, you can set up at your own pace. If you'll be serving a meal to a large group, consider holding your party at your favorite restaurant. Just be sure to let guests know if you expect them to pick up their own checks. Rent a tent or a pavilion if you want to have a large outdoor barbecue for your party, but be sure you have a backup in case it rains.  ", " Decide whether you want a theme for your party. Picking a theme can help set the tone for the whole party, from the music to the decor and even what your guests wear. Of course, you don't have to have a theme, but if something seems fun to you, go for it! If you want to have a Roaring 20s theme, ask the girls to wear feathered headbands and flapper dresses, then decorate everything in black and gold and Art Deco. Serve champagne and play jazzy music when your guests arrive. Throw a 70s disco party by hanging a disco ball, decorating in neons, and playing fun dance music all night. Ask guests to wear platform shoes, bell-bottoms, and plenty of glitter, and have fun fruity cocktails available. Have your friends wear their jeans and cowboy boots to your Country-and-Western-themed party. Play line-dancing music and make sure there's plenty of beer on hand!  ", " Plan a menu you can prepare or pick up before the party starts. Unless you really love cooking all day, try to plan foods that can be prepared ahead of time, or order catering 1-2 weeks in advance if it's in your budget. You can also host a potluck-style party, in which you ask guests to bring a dish of theirs that you really love. If you're not going to serve a meal, opt for a variety of finger foods. Plan for 3-5 servings of appetizers per guest, although you might want to have extra on hand in case of last minute arrivals. If you are having a seated meal, small appetizers like chips and dip or pretzels will whet your guests' appetites without filling them up too much. In this case, 2-3 servings of appetizers per guest should be sufficient. Provide a variety of beverages, including water and soda, even if you're serving cocktails. Some of your guests may not drink, and they'll appreciate having plenty of options. Plan for guests to drink 1 beverage per hour, plus 1 additional drink apiece. If the weather is warm, you may want to have extra drinks on hand, since people will likely drink more.   ", " Order a birthday cake that's large enough to serve all of your guests. The size will depend on the shape of your birthday cake. If you decide on a single-tier 9 inches (23\u00a0cm) round cake, for instance, it will serve 24 people. Consult your baker to determine what size cake you will need based on your guest list.  If you have multiple tiers, you can factor that into your serving size as well. If you don't want a birthday cake, you can have any dessert you like, including cookies, cupcakes, pies, or no dessert at all. After all, it's your birthday!  ", " Host your party earlier in the day if you don't want to serve a meal. If you're thinking of just having light appetizers, it's best to plan your birthday party for about 2 p.m. This will give everyone time to go home and have dinner afterwards if they're hungry.  ", " Ask your friends and family for help if you need it. It's your birthday, so you shouldn't be stressed out! Don't try to do everything on your own. If your mom makes a dip you love or your best friend is awesome at making crafty decorations, ask them if they'll help you. Chances are, they'll probably be happy to add their touch to your birthday!  "], "Inviting Guests": [" Invite more people than you expect to attend the party. Even with plenty of notice, some of your friends and family will have scheduling conflicts, may not feel well the day of your party, or may even forget. Conventional wisdom says that about two-thirds of your invited guests will attend your party.  Of course, you should have extra supplies on hand in case everyone shows up!  ", " Choose guests who will make for a fun atmosphere. Invite people who will bring a positive energy to your party. Try to think of friends who are always positive, who tell the best stories, or who are always happy to meet new people. If you're having a large party, try to invite a mixture of people from different backgrounds, career fields, and even age groups. This will help ensure that your guests enjoy mingling with a variety of different people instead of just the same friends they see all the time.  If you're having a small, intimate gathering, inviting friends who are already close is perfectly fine.  ", " Send out invites 3-6 weeks before the party. In an ideal situation, you'll be able give your guests plenty of notice so they'll have time to clear their schedules. If it's later than that when you start planning, just get the invitation sent as quickly as possible.  Everyone loves getting something in the mail, so if you have enough time, mail paper invites! If you're on a time crunch, online invites are convenient and can reach your guests immediately.  ", " Include the date, time, and location of the party on your invitations. Read through your invitation a couple of times to make sure it covers all of the important information, including how guests can contact you to respond to the invitation.  If your party has a theme or a dress code, include that on the invitation as well.  ", " Ask your guests to donate to a charity in lieu of gifts. Some people think it's tacky to ask for gifts for yourself. Sidestep this issue by stating on the invitation that you would prefer donations to your favorite charity instead of birthday gifts.  ", " Follow up with guests who haven't RSVP'd the week before the party. Remind them about the invitation and ask them if they think they'll be able to attend. This should help you get an estimate on the final head count.  An added bonus to reaching out to your friends is that it will let them know that you genuinely care whether or not they're at the party. Try saying something like, \u201cHey Jane, I haven't heard from you! I'm really hoping you'll be at my party next Friday night, and Sasha and Joe said they're looking forward to seeing you again, too. Do you think you'll be able to make it?\u201d  "], "Setting up the Party": [" Make sure there's enough seating for everyone. If you're going to be serving a meal, there should be at least 1 chair per person, and maybe a few extra just in case someone brings a last-minute guest. If the party is more casual, you should still have enough seating for about 85% of your guests to sit at any one time. ", " Prepare a playlist that will set the mood for your party. You don't want to spend the whole party picking the next song that's going to play. If you don't have a stereo system, ask one of your friends to bring over a bluetooth speaker so you can play music loud enough for everyone to hear. Try playing laid-back tunes as your guests arrive, then transition into upbeat dance music as the night goes on. If you're having a big party, you might want to hire a DJ to keep the music going.  ", " Decorate for the party the day before, if possible. Setting up and decorating for a party almost always takes longer than you plan. If it's possible to set up the day before the party, you'll save yourself some stress on the day of the party. If it's not possible to decorate a day ahead, try to find a couple of friends who you can trust to take charge of the party decor. Ask them to arrive at the venue an hour or so before the party to hang decorations, set out party favors, and arrange chairs.  "], "Enjoying Yourself": [" Greet your guests as they arrive. If the party is at someone's house, answer the door yourself whenever you can. Greet your guests warmly, and try to introduce them to at least one person. If they already know everyone inside, announce their arrival. This will help your guests feel welcome and comfortable as soon as they arrive.  If the party is held at a restaurant or another venue, try to get there early so you can greet guests as they arrive.  ", " Keep guests entertained with fun activities. You don't have to have every minute of the party planned out, but it's a good idea to have a few activities planned to give everyone something to do. If you're having a small get-together, plan a craft project that you and your friends can do together. If everyone at the party is an adult, play a drinking game like . Just make sure everyone who is drinking has a ride home! Put out games like or lawn darts for an outdoor party.  ", " Try to spend time with each of your guests personally. Don't spend too much time in any one place. Move from group to group, mingling with your guests . If you see anyone who seems bored, introduce them to someone you think they'll like. For instance, if 2 people in the room both ride horses, point that out and they'll instantly have something to talk about. If you have a certain friend who always makes other people feel comfortable, take the time to let them know it's really important they attend. You can even ask them to help you work the room, making sure no one is standing alone.   ", " Ask a couple of guests to stay to help you clean up after the party. It's your birthday, so you shouldn't be stuck with the clean-up all by yourself. When the party starts to wind down, ask some of your closest friends if they would mind helping you pick up behind the other guests. Have extra trash bags on hand so you can quickly dispose of paper plates, napkins, and plastic cups. It's a good idea to have extra resealable plastic bags and plastic containers with lids to easily store any leftovers.
