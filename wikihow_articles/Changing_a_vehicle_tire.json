", " Place a heavy object (e.g. , rock, concrete, spare wheel, etc.) in front of the front and back tires.  ", " Take out the spare tire and the jack. Place the jack under the frame near the tire that you are going to change. Ensure that the jack is in contact with the metal portion of your car's frame  Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting.  If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual. For most modern uni-body cars, there is a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed. For most trucks or older cars that have a frame, look to place the jack on one of the beams of the frame just behind the front tire or in front of the rear tire.  ", " Raise the jack until it is supporting (but not lifting) the car. The jack should be firmly in place against the underside of the vehicle. Check to make sure that the jack is perpendicular to the ground.  ", " Remove the hubcap and loosen the nuts by turning counterclockwise . Don't take them all the way off; just break the resistance. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel.  Use the wrench that came with your car or a standard cross wrench. Your wrench may have different sizes of openings on different ends. A correctly-sized wrench will slip easily over the nut, but will not rattle. Try to prepare for any unforeseen tire changes by keeping the exact socket size for your lug nuts as well as a breaker bar handy in the trunk. It can take quite a lot of force to break your lug nuts free. If all else fails, you can use your body weight or stomp on the wrench (be absolutely certain you are turning it the correct way - counterclockwise). However, using your body weight or stomping means you run the risk of stripping the lug nuts, as it is difficult to maintain full contact.  ", " Pump or crank the jack to lift the tire off the ground. You need to lift it high enough to remove the flat tire and replace it with a spare.  As you lift, make sure that the car is stable. If you notice any instability, lower the jack and fix the problem before fully lifting the car. If you notice the jack lifting at an angle or leaning, lower and reposition it so that it can lift straight up. It is always a good idea to keep a small jack stand handy in the vehicle as well, in case the jack gives out during the tire change. Using both the small jack and the normal jack will keep you safe in the event of a jack failure.  ", " Remove the nuts the rest of the way. Turn them counterclockwise until they are loose. Repeat with all lug nuts, then remove the nuts completely.  Although rare, some vehicles actually have reverse threaded lug nuts. These are usually much older cars from Chrysler and GM.

If the jack is placed on a flat, solid base, you shouldn't have any problems.  The tire might stick due to rust. You could try hitting the inside half of the tire with a rubber mallet to loosen the tire, or use the spare tire to hit the outside half.  ", " Place the spare tire on the hub. Take care to align the rim of the spare tire with the wheel bolts, then put on the lug nuts.  Be sure to install the spare tire the correct way and not backwards. The valve stem of a doughnut tire should face outwards, away from the vehicle. If your vehicle uses acorn-style lug nuts, it is easy to put those on backwards as well. Be sure the tapered part of the nut faces the wheel when tightening it down.  ", " Tighten the nuts by hand until they are all snug. They should turn easily at first.  Using the wrench, tighten the nuts as much as possible using a star pattern. To ensure the tire is balanced, don't completely tighten the nuts one at a time. Going in a star pattern around the tire, one nut across from another, give each nut a full turn until they are equally tight. Avoid using so much force that you risk upsetting the jack. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling.  ", " Lower the car without applying full weight on the tire. Tighten the nuts as much as possible.

Changing a truck tire is a relatively simple but valuable skill to learn. Big trucks have big tires that require heavy-duty tools. To manage the truck\u2019s weight, take proper safety precautions by parking it on a stable surface and securing it with a jack and jack stands. Removing the tire is straightforward as long as you have a tool capable of loosening the lug nuts. Swap out the old tire with a new one to get your truck back out on the road.", "content": {"Lifting the Truck": [" Park the vehicle on a hard, level surface. A garage, driveway, or quiet parking lot are a couple of options. Level, stable ground prevents the vehicle from moving while you\u2019re working on the tire. Also, pick a secluded spot where you won\u2019t be disturbed by other vehicles.  Hard surfaces are always better than soft ones. Soft soil, for example, may not be able to support the truck\u2019s weight, causing it to fall off a jack. The spot you choose is an important part of changing a tire safely. If you don\u2019t feel safe where you are, you are better off calling for a tow truck.   ", " Place chocks around the wheels to prevent the truck from moving. Chocks are small rubber blocks you can wedge underneath each wheel. Place a chock in front of and behind each tire other than the one you want to change. If you don\u2019t have chocks, use bricks or wooden boards instead. Make sure they are firmly wedged underneath each wheel so it can\u2019t rotate at all.  Auto part stores sell chocks, but you can also get them online. They are inexpensive but very effective at keeping you safe while working on a truck. You can also engage the truck\u2019s parking brake for additional safety.  ", " Use a screwdriver to pry off the hubcap if your truck has one. Most truck wheels have a metal cover over the lug nuts. If you don\u2019t see exposed lug nuts, then you have a cover to remove. Slip the tip of a flathead screwdriver between the metal cover and the rubber tire. Then, pry the cover toward you in a few different spots to pop it off of the wheel.  Some hubcaps are held in place by lug nuts. Using a lug wrench, loosen all of the nuts gradually and evenly until you are able to remove them. Most pickup trucks and flatbeds have hubcaps. Bigger vehicles, including semi trucks, often have a mix of covered and uncovered wheels.  ", " Turn the lug nuts counterclockwise with a lug wrench to loosen them. Fit the open end of the lug wrench over the nuts one by one to begin removing them. They can be difficult to move at first, but keep trying until you no longer feel any resistance. You may need to step on the wrench or throw your body weight into it to break the lug nut free. Once you feel it come loose, stop turning it and leave it on the wheel.  If you\u2019re having a hard time getting stubborn lug nuts to turn, spray a rust-busting lubricant like WD-40 on them. Lug wrenches are fine for pickups and flatbeds, but you will most likely need something stronger for bigger vehicles. Try using a breaker bar if you\u2019re doing it manually. For an easier way to detach the nuts, get a 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) cordless impact wrench. It\u2019s a handheld tool similar to drill, but it has an open end meant to fit over lug nuts.  ", " Raise the truck up by fitting a jack under it. Select a jack that is strong enough to support the truck\u2019s weight, such as a hydraulic bottle jack. Many vehicles have notches near the wheel wells indicating a safe spot to place the jack. When using a bottle jack, pump the handle up and down to raise the truck. Lift it so the wheel is about 6\u00a0in (15\u00a0cm) off the ground.  For safety, position the jack along a metal part of the frame rather than the plastic exterior. Check the owner\u2019s manual if you are unable to locate the jack point just by looking at the truck. To lift heavier trucks, including dump trucks and similar haulers, use a hydraulic lift instead. Park the truck on the lift, then pump the handle to raise it. The biggest lifts are capable of supporting the additional weight. Really big trucks like semis often don\u2019t need to be lifted. The other wheels are capable of supporting the truck\u2019s weight.  ", " Fit jack stands underneath the truck next to the jack. Pull the jack stands up so they reach the bottom of the truck. Then, slide them into place, making sure they are supporting the truck\u2019s metal frame. The jack stands support the weight of the truck so it can\u2019t fall off the jack. Use at least 2 jack stands to hold up the truck and prevent it from falling off the jack.  Consider using 4 or more jack stands, especially when dealing with anything heavier than a standard pickup truck.

The lug nuts come first and should be easy to remove since you loosened them earlier. Twist them as much as you can by hand. If you are unable to remove them all of the way, finish the job with a lug wrench or breaker bar.  Spray a lubricant like WD-40 as needed to loosen stubborn nuts. You most likely won\u2019t have to use any once the nuts are loose, but have a bottle on hand just in case. Having an impact wrench makes the removal process much easier, although you won\u2019t need it unless the nuts are really stuck.  ", " Pull the wheel off of the truck and set it on the ground. Wheels are heavy, especially for bigger trucks, so take your time. Once the lug nuts are off, you should be able to pull the tire toward you. Grip the top and bottom of the wheel, then pull it toward you. Wear gloves to keep your hands clean and maintain a firmer grip on the wheel.  Some trucks, including semis and some pickups, have double wheels. If you need to access an interior tire, pull it off after removing the exterior tire. You may need to get on your back and go under the car to undo the nuts.  ", " Mount the new tire on the truck\u2019s lug bolts. Line up the holes in the wheel with the lug bolts in the wheel well. After sliding the wheel onto the bolts, push it back as far as you can. If you\u2019re replacing a double wheel, fit both wheels onto the lug bolts.
