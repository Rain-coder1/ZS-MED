It gives you a chance to build a stronger bond with your dog, and also to show off your canine friend to an adoring public. But, before your dog can trot to success, you need to train it for the stage so it can steal the show. This will be easiest if you begin when your dog is still a puppy.", "content": {"Getting Ready to Train": [" Make sure your dog is eligible to participate. Before you invest a lot of time and effort in training your dog, you will want to make certain your dog will be allowed to take part in dog shows. Only purebred dogs over six months old that are not spayed or neutered may take part in American Kennel Club (AKC) shows. That's because the purpose of these events is to judge whether your dog is good breeding stock.  Your dog must also be as a purebred with the appropriate breed club and conform to all breed guidelines. If you got your dog from a breeder, they probably gave you the certification paperwork showing your dog is registered. If not, you'll need to contact the appropriate breed club. The AKC has an online directory you can use to contact the club.  If your dog is spayed or neutered, there are other events you can take part in. The United Kennel Club (UKC) has an \"altered\" class that allows these dogs to compete.  If your dog is not a purebred, it can compete in shows organized by mixed breed dog clubs.    ", " Attend some dog shows. The next step is to attend some dog shows to get a better sense of what it's all about.  This will help you get a better sense of what judges are looking for, and what you can expect when you enter your dog.  This is also a great way to get more information about the show process and preparing your dog. Visit the club table or tent to pick up information on entering your dog and training classes offered by the club.   ", " Get the right lead. When your dog walks out into the ring, you'll need to have it on the right kind of leash or \"lead.\" The sooner you get one of these, the sooner your dog can get comfortable with being on it. Go online or ask at your local pet store for one of these: For small dogs, you can use a Resco \u201call in one\u201d style collar with lead. The Resco is a loop with a slider to keep it snug on the dog\u2019s neck.  For a medium sized dog, you can use a martingale lead. These leads close up enough to keep your dog's head from slipping out, but don't tighten around a dog's neck like a choke-chain. They also help to train your dog to keep its head held up high while showing judges their gait, and while stacking. The other commonly used lead is the chain and show lead. This is not as elegant as the martingale, but many handlers use them for larger, boxer breeds such as the Rottweiler. These also help your dog to keep its head held high, and to not run away in the ring.  ", " Enter your dog in a local ring raft class. These classes help you train your dog for a show. Although this is not necessary, it is recommended. Ringcraft classes can help you socialize your dog to other people and dogs. They can also help the dog learn to walk on a lead without being distracted by other dogs.  These classes can also be a great source of information about shows and showing. They can be a good opportunity to meet other people involved in showing dogs.   "], "Training your Dog for Show": [" Practice gaiting. Gaiting is moving your dog in a way that allows the judge to see their movement and structure. The correct gait is usually a trot, with the dogs head up. A trotting dog\u2019s right front leg and left back leg move forward at the same time, then the left front with the right back. Trotting is the correct pace because it shows the dog\u2019s true structure the best. To start, use treats to lure your dog to follow you around without a lead. The dog should remain at your left side. Once the dog is comfortable wearing the collar and walking beside you, formal lead training can begin. Attach a show lead to the dog's collar, pick up the dog and carry it a short distance away from your home. Put it down and walk back toward your house at a speed that encourages the dog to trot, holding the other end of the lead. The dog should be happy to go toward home and follow you. Repeat this process, carrying the dog farther away from home each time. If your dog fights the lead, back away and offer it treats to come toward you.  ", " Teach your dog to \u201chand stack. \u201d To succeed, all dogs must learn to \"stack,\" or stand squarely and still. In hand stacking, you manually place each leg in position while standing or kneeling close to the dog. Dogs will have to stack several times during a show. Many people let dogs \"free stack\" most of the time, but hand stack right before the judge's examination. This ensures the best possible stance for the dog.  The specific position your dog should be in will vary by breed. Consult the guidelines for your breed, available from the appropriate club.  To train for hand stacking, keep a good-sized treat in your right hand. Keep it partially covered so the dog can only nibble on it as you adjust the positions of the dog's feet with your left hand. Adjust the dog's front legs first, moving them at the elbow. Then, keeping your left hand on the dog at all times, move to the back legs and adjust them at the hock. Never stack by touching the dog's feet, as this may cause it to shift its whole body. Repeat this until your dog is comfortable with the process.  Finally, teach the dog to maintain that position. Pull the food away for a second and tell the dog to stay. If it holds the position, say \"yes!\" and give the dog a nibble of the food. If it doesn't, restack the dog and try again.   ", " Teach your dog to \"free stack. \" Free stacking is when your dog assumes the proper position on command, rather than with manual adjustment. This is most easily done with some training treats and clicker. To begin with, click and reward your dog whenever it stands. If it keeps standing, reward it again. Keep doing this until the dog offers the stand position spontaneously.  Next teach \u201cback up.\u201d Step toward the dog and click and treat any shift of movement backward, which should result in the dogs back legs aligning. Repeat this process with the command, clicking and reward increasingly correct backing up behavior.  Then, teach the dog to align its front legs with the command \"step.\" To teach this command, step back and click and treat as soon as the dog moves a front foot forward. Once the dog does this easily, say \u201cstep\u201d just before you prompt it. Repeat this until the dog aligns it's front feet on command.  Finally, teach the command \"stack.\" Click and treat every time the dog is in the correct position. Repeat if the dog holds that position. Eventually, you'll be able to just use the \"stack\" command without \"back up\" and \"step.\"   ", " Bait train your dog. You want your dog to also look alert and happy when stacked. Most breeds should have their attention on the handler and the judge, and have their ears perked and their eyes on you. Training your dog to look at you is something you can begin the first time you feed the dog a meal. When you put the food bowl down, repeat the word \u201ccookie\" over and over. This repetition will teach the puppy to associate a food with that word. Later, use this command to focus your dog's attention on you while offering it treats from your hand when it is in a stacked position. This causes the dog stretch its neck upward to look at you. This pose shows the dogs outline and balance to the judge.  ", " Teach the dog tolerate examination. In a dog show, judges will physically examine a dog, touching its body and mouth. A successful show dog will need to tolerate this without complaint. A good first step in getting your dog accustomed to this is to to touch the dog all over its body daily, including inside its mouth. If you start this at a young age, your dog will quickly grow accustomed to it.  Next, begin giving your dog regular inspections that approximate those of a judge. Closely examine the dog's teeth. For males, touch the testicles. Do this on both a table and the floor, if your dog is smaller in size. While small dogs are usually inspected on a table, some judges will begin inspection while the dog is still on the ground. Finally, when the dog is comfortable with your inspections, bring in a second person and ask ask them to do the same. This way, your dog will get comfortable with inspection by strangers.

To work out whether your Maltese is show-worthy or not, you\u2019ll need to familiarize yourself with the competition\u2019s guidelines and inspect your dog for qualifying characteristics. Focus on your dog\u2019s physical appearance as well as its trainability and personality traits.", "content": {"Examining Physical Features": [" Assess the body of the dog. The standard body of a Maltese is compact. Typically, the distance from the withers (shoulders) to the root (base) of the tail should be the same as the distance from the withers to the ground. Its back should be level from the tail to the shoulders. The dog's chest should be slightly deep and the loins should be tight and slightly tucked under.  The dog's neck should hold the head in a high position, almost as if the dog is holding its head back a little. The tail should be curled over the dog\u2019s hind end. The tail should also be plumed. The front feet can be slightly turned out, but turned out back feet are not permitted. The Maltese pup\u2019s paw pads should be completely black.   ", " Inspect the dog\u2019s face. The face of a dog is one of the most important aspects of a show dog, especially when it is being closely scrutinized by a judge during a competition. A Maltese dog should have a slightly rounded head on top with drop ears and a medium length snout.  The dog should have a black nose, with its eyes a deep brown or black. The skin around the eyes should be dark. The jaw should be lined up in a scissor bite. A parrot or sow bite is considered not desirable for this breed.   ", " Check the appearance of the coat. The coat should be pure white. But it can be common to see cream, tan, or lemon ears. These colors should be seen nowhere else on the coat. It is preferable not even to have these pigments on the ears, although it is still permitted if they are light and barely noticeable.  The coat should be silky and thin, never greasy. Maltese dogs can also have red fur on their feet, but this is not permitted in most show competitions.  ", " Ensure that a male dog has two scrotal testicles. The testicles should appear normal and fully descended. Retained testicles are not acceptable on the dog show circuit.  "], "Identifying Desirable Personality Traits": [" Look for obedience. One of the most important traits for a Maltese show dog to possess is obedience. This trainability should be at least somewhat obvious, even as a young puppy. Notice if the dog listens to you when you speak to it and if it seems to adapt its behavior based on previous learning experiences.  Try telling the dog \u201cno\u201d to a behavior you don\u2019t want it to do. If the dog seems to understand, or at least try to, then this is a good sign for trainability.  ", " Monitor for temperament. Personality is one of the things these dogs are known for. The dog you are showing should be fearless. They are sweet dogs that are not at all aggressive. The personality needs to be playful. Any Maltese without these traits is not show worthy.  You want a Maltese dog that is comfortable around people and not afraid of a crowd. Your dog should not be aggressive or shy.  ", " Meet the parents. If you are purchasing a puppy, meet the parents of the litter. If you cannot meet the father, at least see the mom. By observing the behaviors of the parents, you should be able to get an idea about the temperament of your puppy.  Behavioral characteristics in dogs are often shared genetically \u2013 so a dog that is mild-mannered is likely to give birth to puppies with similar mild-mannered temperaments. And vice versa with disobedient or aggressive behaviors. This is also a great way to get an estimate about the ultimate size your Maltese puppy will grow to.  "], "Understanding Show Guidelines": [" Acquire registration papers. All Maltese dogs entered in shows must be registered as purebreds. In most cases, you should have been given your dog\u2019s registration papers directly from the breeder when you acquired the dog. Most U.S. competition shows require AKC registration, so be sure to verify that. In some competitions, other types of registrations are partially acceptable. For example, CKS and APRI registered dogs are often allowed to participate in most events at shows, only excluding the Conformation event. If you don\u2019t have any papers for your purebred Maltese dog (and you can\u2019t get any from the breeder), you can contact the AKC to see what they can do to help you. In some cases, accreditation can be given with photo evidence and written statements by witnesses who claim that the dog is a purebred.  ", " Maintain weight requirements. Check to see whether the dog complies with size breed standards according to the AKC. The AKC requires a Maltese to be under seven pounds (3.2 kg), but four to six pounds (1.8 - 2.7 kg) is preferable.  You could also check with another relevant body, such as the Kennel Club. In some cases, the show entity will have its own rules regarding breed-specific weight requirements.  ", " Get the necessary training. Many dog competition shows require a certain amount of training to prove that your dog is ready for entry in a real competition show. This training involves obedience tests and command tests.  To get your Maltese to a point where it is ready to succeed in a dog show, you\u2019ll need to focus on . This means practicing commands, establishing your position as the leader, rewarding your dog when it behaves correctly, leash training, and teaching your dog some simple commands. Once your dog masters some easy commands (like \u201csit,\u201d \u201cstay,\u201d and \u201ccome\u201d), you can move to more complicated tasks like fetching, following you without a leash, and rolling over. Make sure your dog knows how to stand and carry itself well so that its flowing coat is on display. Some shows also require entry into a preliminary competition at an unofficial dog show called \u201cMatches.\u201d These events are still hosted by kennel clubs and help dogs become more socialized and accustomed to the show atmosphere.  ", " Aim for success. A successful Maltese show dog must have a willingness to perform, which often translates into a demanding, pushy attitude. Winning show dogs often want to be the center of attention with their owners.  A dog who loves to perform, even under pressure, will be able to succeed in the stressful show environment when other dogs may break due to the stress of the situation.

The American Kennel Club Study Guides are very comprehensive collections that will be helpful to you as you begin to breed dogs and to become a judge.  Guides cover breed history, breed standard, give information about the breed's parent national parent club and regional clubs. They also list experienced breeders and exhibitors who may be willing to share their knowledge with new breed enthusiasts. Most judges are experts in a few different dog breeds, but you must be knowledgeable about the majority of dog breeds in order to judge at smaller shows.  ", " Select dogs to breed. Once you have determined the type of dog that you want to breed and to judge, you need to begin the breeding process. Most kennel clubs will require that you breed a certain amount of litters and a certain number of champion dogs in order to be considered as a judge. You will need to have a dam, which is a female that you can breed, and a sire, which is a male that will breed with the female. You want both dogs to be in the top 10% of their breed. This means that the dogs are great specimens of the breed and meet nearly, if not all, the breed characteristics that are laid out in the breed standard.  Breeding dogs is an expensive endeavor. You may need to pay another breeder to allow their male to breed with your female, you will need to purchase supplies to keep a female in your home, and you must be prepared to raise puppies for at least 8 weeks. Find an established breeder that is willing to be your mentor and find a veterinarian that you can consult throughout the process. Once the female becomes pregnant, you will need to take care of her during her pregnancy until the puppies come.  ", " Raise your first litter. When you have a litter of puppies, you will be able to determine whether any of these puppies are of show dog quality. There are puppy divisions of many dog shows where you can begin to exhibit your dogs.  Bring the puppies to a veterinarian so they can undergo genetic testing. You will need to make sure that the puppies are not at risk for genetic diseases and conditions, and to ensure that they are purebred.  ", " Register your litter. You must register your new puppies with your club organization in order to begin to show the dogs.  Having documentation that you have bred successful litters of puppies will be essential during your judging application. For organizations like the AKC, you will need to breed 5 litters of the same breed to qualify with the 12-5-4 process. You may need to produce many litters in order to have 4 championship dogs. Breeding dogs is a time intensive and costly process. You should expect to spend multiple years during this stage of the judge application process.  ", " Show your litter. Many organizations require that their judges have experience showing dogs that they have bred. Once you have your first litter and have registered them with the kennel club, you can begin to exhibit the dogs. There are puppy divisions of dog shows that you can exhibit puppies at, or you can wait until the dogs are several months old so they can participate in different show categories.  If you are unfamiliar with how to show your dog, you can attend a class taught by your kennel club or hire a professional handler to show your dog for you.   ", " Repeat the breeding process. Most organizations will require that you have bred several successful litters of purebred dogs in order to qualify to become a judge. Once you have begun the breeding process, you will need to repeat it until you have met organization requirements. "], "Applying To Be A Judge": [" Fill out and submit your initial application. This application should be completed and returned to your organization at the onset of your application process. It primarily signals your intent to become a dog show judge.  Be prepared to share documentation during your initial application, such as proof that you have bred specific numbers of litters. There are typically fees associated with your initial application, but these will range depending on your organization. For example, the AKC charges US$30 initially. The United Kennel Club, another United States organization, charges US$25.  This initial application will cover your basic background information and will ask questions about your breeding and dog show experience.  ", " Attend training. Once you have submitted your initial judging application and the organization approves it, you can begin the organization-specific training to become a dog show judge. Training may take place over weeks or months, be in person or online. It depends on your organization and the breed that you have selected to judge. For organizations like the AKC, new breed judges are required to attend an institute before requesting regular (full) status as a judge, but no less than 2 years before submitting the initial application. The Canine College is a great online source of information for aspiring dog judges and breed enthusiasts.   ", " Take any training exams. If your organization requires, you may need to take and pass exams about breed standards, organization rules, dog anatomy, and the judging selection process. For example, the United Kennel Club requires you to pass two written exams on breed standards and UKC rules. You will need to commit to learning and studying the history of the breed, the exact breed standard, the judging process, your organization's rules, dog anatomy, and to be familiar with any changes in the dog show world.  ", " Interview with judge evaluators. Some organizations require that you interview with evaluators in order to progress through the application process. These interviews may take place before or after you attend judge training. These are often in person interviews where an evaluator will judge your knowledge on your selected breed. They may ask you to judge a few dogs to examine your judging process and to evaluate how accurate you are with conforming to breed standards. Often, these evaluators act as liaisons between applicants and the organization.   ", " Complete your judge application. Once you have completed the necessary training, exams, and interviews that the organization requires, you can submit your final judge application. Gather documentation that proves that you have completed the required steps, like training and exams, to submit along with your application. The judge application will be similar to the first application that you submitted at the beginning of the process that signaled your intent to become a judge. It will be used by the judge selection committee to determine that you have met all of the organization\u2019s requirements. If your application is not accepted, you may be able to request an appeal from the judging committee. You can also wait and gain more experience before applying again.   ", " Apply for provisional judging status. If your application has been approved, you will need to register with your organization as a new judge. This will establish you as a provisional judge that is able to begin judging at events. Many organizations will publish the names and biographies of new judges, so dog show coordinators are aware that there are new judges available.  ", " Apply for regular judging status. For some organizations, like the American Kennel Club, you may need to judge a certain number of shows as a provisional judge before you can receive your regular judging status. Once you have judged a certain number of events, the AKC requires you to judge 5 events, you can apply for full judging status.  This is the final step in the application process. Once you have been accepted as a regular judge, you are now able to begin your career as an official dog show judge with your kennel club.

However, if you wish to improve your dog's show ring gait, you can do so at home if you have plenty of time and patience.  Observe your dog's show ring gait and decide what needs improvement using feedback from a dog show judge or your own judgement.  Adopt a clicker and reward system that lets your dog know when they are gaiting properly.  Then, train your dog to gait in the way you wish, starting without a leash and then moving over to leash training when they improve.", "content": {"Adhering to General Rules": [" Use the collar and leash you'll use during the show.

If you need to make a change to your dog's collar or leash due to show rules or for any other reason, do so during training.   ", " Decide what needs improvement. A dog's show ring gait is comprised of several discrete elements.  Identify whether your dog's straight-line movement, left and right turns, amble, or trot need work.  Your dog's gait might also need to be adjusted based on its relation to the leash.  If your dog pulls the leash too tightly, it will not walk properly.  ", " Correct one aspect at a time. If your dog's show ring gait needs several corrections \u2013 for instance, perhaps your dog's speed and distance from you are wrong \u2013 only take on one correction at a time.  Adjusting your dog's show ring gait in even one way can be difficult.  Therefore, the best approach is to take only one thing at a time.  After your dog has corrected one aspect of its show ring gait, begin adding other elements that you want it to correct.  ", " Do not tease or bait your dog. Waving food around in front of your dog or getting your dog wound up will not help your training process.  You should be teaching your dog that the clicker is the reward, not the treat itself.

The important thing is to keep the clicker or clicker substitute consistent throughout training, otherwise your dog could be confused.  ", " Find a partner. It is easier to engage in clicker training if you give your dog a treat while another person utilizes the clicker, or vice versa.  Ask a family member or friend to help you improve your dog's show ring gait.  Alternately, locate someone else who is also interested in improving their dog's show ring gait.  That way, you and the other person can take turns helping each other improve your dogs' show ring gaits.  With a partner, one of you can stand in a central position observing from a distance with a clicker, while the other one can walk along the dog holding its leash and administering treats when as needed.

An example is wearing cream trousers to show a Doberman(black and tan). A jacket of the same color presents nice, simple, elongated, eye appeal. Girls should tie their hair back. "], "What to expect when you enter your first junior handling competition": [" Wear your ring number on a show clip, on your arm, or clipped on with a safety pin.   ", " You will enter the ring with the other competitors and stand in a line with the dog stacked in front of you. The dog's side faces forward and its head positioned next to your right hand. Now is when the dog should be stacked. The judge will maybe ask everyone to move their dog around in a circle. Make sure to always leave enough room between the dog in front and you-three feet is a good goal. Move your dog at the right pace-you will need to trot a large dog so wait for the dog in front to go round a bit before you start. ", " The steward will ask the first person to go to the front and stack their dog. If you are new to the sport do not go first but watch what the exhibitors in front of you do. When the dog in front of you starts moving, it is time for you to set your dog up for the judge. The judge will look over your dog and ask you to do a pattern. When you return to him stand your dog again, say \"Thank you\" to the judge, and go to the back of the line ", " When the last person is doing their pattern, you need to stack your dog.  ", " If you are lucky enough to be placed, go where the steward designates, and stand your dog. You will then be given a rosette. If you do not win, don't lose heart, but say thank you to the judge and congratulate the winner. Always remember there will be another show and winning one isn't really a big deal in the general scheme of things. ", " Soon you will gain confidence and will enter larger shows.  "]}}, "How to Prepare Your Old English Sheepdog for a Show": {"description": "The Old English Sheepdog is a wonderful, fun-loving pet. The AKC states \" This breed is a strong, compact, square, balanced dog. Taking him all around, he is profusely, but not excessively coated, thickset, muscular and able-bodied. These qualities, combined with his agility, fit him for the demanding tasks required of a shepherd's or drover's dog. Therefore, soundness is of the greatest importance. His bark is loud with a distinctive \"pot-casse\" ring in it.\" So, you want to raise and show this lovable pooch? Read on.", "content": {"Steps": [" Think about what you are getting into. Are you doing this on impulse? This is a very large commitment, and Old English Sheepdogs are not for first-time owners, let alone for first-time breeders. Hopefully, you've had lots of experience with other breeds and breeding dogs in the past, or this is going to be a fun, yet hard challenge for you. ", " Plan out your costs. Owning, breeding, showing, traveling, vet bills, etc cost a lot of money. Make a chart based on weekly, monthly, and yearly costs for owning one dog, and decide if you really can afford even more. Talk to breeders for information on costs, and travel to a dog show to see if you really want to make this commitment. ", " Decide and evaluate your reason for breeding. If you want to breed conformation show-line dogs, you should probably get your bitch/stud from a champion-line breeder, knowing the commitment it takes to grooming, showing, and traveling to shows. Not to mention a grooming workshop for your breed, or expenses for trips to the groomer before a show. If you want to breed for herding, you should purchase your bitch/stud from a working line breeding kennel, yet knowing the commitment it takes to training, traveling, grooming, etc. of having a working sheepdog. You would also need to travel to your nearest open sheepdog classes to keep your herding dog entertained. ", " Get serious. Nobody cares for you to be just a \"pet\" breeder. You can be a show breeder and have pet-quality puppies that aren't fit for the ring, but you should always try to have nice, sound, healthy puppies for working or show stock. These are working animals that need a job to stay entertained and healthy. "], "Knowing Where to Get Your Dog": [" Look for a reputable breeder. The best places to spot one are in Dog Fancy classifieds, Dog World classifieds, AKC Gazette, or www.akc.org where you can find the breeder classifieds. Also, a great place to spot your breeder is at your local kennel club's dog show. Internet listings are not the best, as many of the dogs come from puppy mills. Also, never buy your dog from a pet store, as they always come from puppy mills with multitudes of health problems. Find a breeder that specializes in the area you would like to specialize in, whether it is herding, agility, obedience, or conformation.  ", " Make sure the breeder scans her sires and dams for health problems found in the breed! This is the most important aspect of breeding- do not buy from anyone who does not perform health scans on their dogs! You should do this also when breeding your future dogs. "], "Prep yourself": [" Prepare yourself for a new puppy, and possibly more in the future.  ", " Take a grooming course for your breed. If you are going to breed the Old English Sheepdog, you are going to need your dogs to be well groomed and presentable. You will usually be able to find courses from your local kennel club, or from the breeder you are choosing to get your dog from. ", " Puppy-proof the house. Make sure your house is safe for your puppy. Make sure electric cords are out of the \"chewing zone\", all plastic bits and paper are out of \"choking zone\", and that you have baby gates put up in places that are off limits to pooches. ", " Buy your supplies. There are many pages on wikiHow that will tell you what supplies that you need for your new puppy. Buy all your necessities for your new puppy that you will be bringing home. ", " Set up a vet appointment in advance. Set up a vet appointment before you get your puppy so that you do not have to wait over a month for Fido to get its last set of puppy booster shots. The date should be the day after you get your poochie. Your breeder (if local) will probably give you a preferred vet, but do your research and find the best veterinarian in your area. "], "Getting Your Dog": [" Visit the breeder's litter. After you've found your breeder, schedule a time where you can see their newest or upcoming litter. ", " Ask the breeder's advice. Ask the breeder which puppy would be likely to do the best in herding, breeding, showing, etc. Breeders will always try to help you find the best puppy, as they are committed to making their breed the best as possible. ", " Choose your puppy. Make sure your puppy is healthy, strong, playful, and a little curious. Never get a sick puppy. Signs of a sick puppy are: Discharge coming out of the nose, or eyes. Stinky/Waxy/Red ears Signs of diarrhea Weak limbs  ", " Bring your puppy home. Bring your puppy home. You should preferably pick the puppy up at the breeder's, even if it is a long drive. This will save the puppy the stress of shipping on a plane, which causes trauma, and sometimes even death. "], "Socializing Your Puppy": [" Enroll your puppy in a basic obedience course. Make sure it is a \"puppy only\" class, and that the instructor uses POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT only. This class should meet weekly. An easy obedience course like this will help your puppy learn how to react in a new environment, and how to react with other dogs and people. Eventually, you can enroll your puppy in higher obedience courses so that you can maybe even compete, although this is not necessary. ", " Schedule puppy play-dates! Call your friends up and schedule a puppy play date with their dog and your puppy. Make sure that their dog is current on all vaccinations. This will help your puppy learn to play and interact with other dogs in a non-threatening environment. ", " Bring your puppy with you to places. First, you need to make sure that it has all its shots, or it could pick up a disease. Bring your puppy with you to pick your kids up from school, when you go to work (if it is okay with your boss), and maybe even to a couple of dog shows. This will help your puppy feel easier in new environments, and to enjoy car rides. ", " Introduce your puppy to livestock (if it will be herding). You need to introduce your puppy to livestock at a young age so that it will not panic when you start training. ", " Introduce your puppy to cats and other small critters- you don't want any eaten ones showing up on your doorstep! This is optional. ", " Start grooming early. I don't know any groomer/breeder/handler/trainer who wouldn't stress this! Introduce your puppy to all grooming tools at a young age so that it will enjoy it in the years to come. Groom it gently each day for 10 minute intervals. "], "Starting Your Training Early": [" Enroll your puppy in a ringcraft class. Your local kennel club should have a weekly ringcraft class. Enroll your puppy asap. ", " Bring your puppy to herding class although his instincts may not have kicked in yet, bring your puppy to herding class so it can at least get used to the livestock.  ", " As mentioned above, you NEED to enroll your puppy in a basic obedience course!  ", " If you choose to do agility with your sheepdog, enroll it in a PUPPY class so that they will not have stress on their joints.  ", " Enroll your puppy in any class that you would like that is not mentioned, whether it be animal acting, schutzhund (although sheepdogs don't excel in it particularly), freestyle disc, or fly ball.  ", " Remember- whichever sport you choose to do, start early!  "]}}}
