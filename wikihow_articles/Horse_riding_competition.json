{"How to Think of a Show Name for Your Horse or Pony": {"description": "If you are planning to show your horse, you may want to come up with a more interesting name than what you call your horse on a daily basis. If your horse is registered with a particular organization (e.g. AQHA, the Jockey Club, etc.) you will need to contact the organization to confirm their rules about show names. When choosing a show name for your horse, you can draw from multiple sources of inspiration. You can build off of your horse\u2019s stable name or personality. You can draw inspiration from your horses breed or appearance. You can also ask friends for ideas or look through name books.", "content": {"Brainstorming Ideas Based on Your Horse": [" Use your horse\u2019s stable name as the main inspiration. Most horses aren\u2019t called by their show name every day. That is because these names are usually a bit long and impractical. However, you can use the name you typically call your horse by as a good source of inspiration.  Think about your horse's stable name and try combining it with descriptive and creative word(s) of your horse's glory in the show ring, your horses personality, or your horse's favorite things to do. For example, if you have a mare called \u201cAutumn,\u201d you could call her \u201cAutumn Glory,\u201d \u201cAutumn Charm,\u201d or \u201cAutumn's Mischief.\u201d If you have a gelding called \u201cBlaze,\u201d you could call him \u201cBlaze's Pride,\u201d or \u201cCopyrighted with a Blaze.\u201d   ", " Make the stable name more interesting. You can choose a totally different show name, but still use your horse\u2019s stable name as inspiration. Think about your horse\u2019s name, and then come up with a way of describing that name. For example, if you owned a filly named \u201cStar,\u201d you could call her \u201cBorn to Shine,\u201d \u201cShine Forever,\u201d \u201cBright Future,\u201d or \u201cShining for Life.\u201d  ", " Come up with several variations. You don\u2019t have to choose your horse\u2019s name in one day, so spend time coming up with different variations of your horse\u2019s name. Write them all down no matter how good or bad you think they sound at first. If your horse\u2019s stable name is \u201cDash\u201d then there are lots of potential show names. For example, \u201cThunder Dash,\u201d \u201cSlap Dash,\u201d \u201cMad Dash,\u201d or \u201cSilver Knight.\u201d  ", " Consider your horse's abilities. If you want to show your horse, then they may have a skill that they are particularly good at, and this could serve as a good source of inspiration for your horse\u2019s show name. If your horse is a jumper, you could call him \u201cJumping at Dawn.\u201d If your horse prefers classic dressage, you could call her \u201cJust a Classic.\u201d Most race horses have names that are in some way associated with running (e.g. \u201cBluegrass Stampede\u201d).  ", " Use your horse\u2019s past as inspiration. If your horse has a particularly interesting past then you can include this in their name in some way. For example, if your horse was rescued from a bad situation, then you could combine their stable name with \u201cSecond Chance.\u201d For example, \u201cRisby\u2019s Second Chance.\u201d  "], "Using Physical Traits for Inspiration": [" Name them based on the name of the parents. It is quite common to choose your horse\u2019s name based on their lineage. If you have access to the information, look for the names of the dam (the female horse) and the sire (the male horse). See if you can combine the names in an interesting way, or if these names inspire you. For example, if one horse was named \u201cMidnight Lady\u201d and the other was named \u201cCrown Jewel,\u201d you could call your horse \u201cMidnight Jewel\u201d or even \u201cCrown Lady,\u201d if your horse is female.  ", " Think about where your horse was bred and born. If your horse was born in a notable place, then consider using the name of the town or city in their name.  For example, if they were bred in Sligo, then why not call them, \u201cSligo Spot On\u201d or \u201cSligo\u2019s Star.\u201d  ", " Consider the origins of your horse\u2019s breed. Many horse breed names refer to where in the world that breed comes from. You can use the breed name or the name of the country as inspiration for your horse\u2019s name.  For example, an Arabian could have a name that has something to do with an Arabian sheik or the desert. A Mustang could have a name like \u201cWild\u201d or \u201cHeart of America.\u201d An Andalusian horse could be called something like \u201cAndalusian Surprise\u201d or \u201cSpanish Beauty.\u201d You can also add a bit of the language of that country to the name. For example, if you have a French bred horse, they could be called something that starts with \u201cLe \u2026\u201d (for a male horse) or \u201cLa \u2026\u201d (for a female horse).  ", " Think about your horse\u2019s color, interesting features, and markings. Many horses are named for something that makes them look unique. Spend time thinking about what physical features make your horse interesting. Maybe they have mane that falls in a unique way, or markings that form a shape, or maybe they have a beautifully colored coat. If using your horse\u2019s coat color as inspiration try to be creative. Rather than choosing a name like, \u201cChestnut Boy\u201d for your chestnut colored horse, try names like \u201cFirebird\u201d or \u201cDark Star.\u201d With markings, you can always use common names of markings (star, snip, blaze, stripe, etc.) to add to your horse's barn name. This is a fairly common practice though, so your horse\u2019s name is unlikely to be especially unique.  "], "Finding Inspiration Elsewhere": [" Look at books. You can go to the library and look through name books or you can purchase books, if you want. You might be able to find books that are specific to horse names, but it is not uncommon to give a horse a human name so don\u2019t forget to skim through some baby name books.  Don't be afraid to use a unique name that isn't used nowadays. Looking through library books will save you money. Unless you have a lot of horses, you probably will only use the book once, so the library is a good option.  ", " Ask friends for help. Some people are great at coming up with cool names. Friends will probably have a fresh perspective, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask for suggestions. If a friend gives you a suggestion, write it down on your list, and say, \u201cThank you!\u201d Don\u2019t suggest that you\u2019re going to go with the name just to be polite. They may feel offended if they think you\u2019re going to use their suggestion, and then find out you\u2019ve chosen something else.  ", " Consider naming your horse after your stable or your sponsor. If you live on a ranch or farm that has a name, and you bred your horse yourself, you can name your horse after that. If you keep your horse at a stable, you can include the name of stables. If you are sponsored by someone, you might consider including that person\u2019s name, the name of their ranch/farm/stables, or the name of their business as part of the show name.  For example, if you keep your horse at a stable called, \u201cWinter Creek\u201d you could call your horse \u201cWinter Creek\u2019s Surprise.\u201d  "]}}, "How to Prepare for a Horse Show": {"description": "Anyone who has ever shown a horse knows the thrilling but sometimes stressful times right before you enter the arena. Rather than waiting until the last minute to prepare for a show, take steps from well before the event to get ready and you'll have your most relaxing and successful show yet!", "content": {"Preparing Your Horse Far in Advance": [" Groom on a daily basis year-round. If you want a truly show-ready horse, keep their coat in perfect order all the time. Grooming your horse every day does two things: increases emotional bonding, and increases the health and shine of their coat. A win-win situation, huh? Spend the most time with a curry comb to work out dirt and loose hair that cause your horse to appear dull and dusty. Be sure to pick your horse\u2019s hooves on a daily basis as well. Keeping them clean will make it more comfortable for your horse, and better-looking in the long run. Spend time brushing the dock of your horse\u2019s tail to stimulate hair growth. Your horse\u2019s tail will end up becoming fuller and more healthy as a result of spreading the natural oils and stimulating the hair follicles.   ", " Feed your horse a coat-enhancing grain. There are many different feed products on the market that are full of the nutrients necessary to enhance the thickness and shine of your horse\u2019s coat and mane/tail. If your horse is able (based on dietary circumstances), incorporate one of these grains into their regular eating throughout the year, at least several months prior to a show. You can also feed your horse small servings of dried bread crumbs. This really will make their coat shine, just be careful to not make your horse sick!  ", " Take care of your horse\u2019s mane and tail. If the mane and tail of your horse are constantly ratted and full of debris, it will be very difficult to get them looking good in time for showing. Brush your horse\u2019s mane and tail thoroughly every time you groom them, and rub in some cocoa butter once every few days. This will act as a conditioner, making their hair thicker and softer over time. When necessary, use a detangler to help reduce the number of knots.  their mane and tail occasionally (when flies are low) to keep the hair from getting in more knots.  ", " Keep up your horse\u2019s medical treatment. A horse that is underweight, overweight, has worms, or any other illness/ailment won\u2019t show as well. Make sure that you are keeping your horse\u2019s health in mind throughout the year, instead of doing last-minute worming and medication the week of a show. A healthy horse will work better and be much more presentable than an unhealthy horse. You should also ensure that your horse is up to date on its vaccines and meets any other important health standards.  "], "Getting Your Horse Ready 1-2 Days in Advance": [" Bathe your horse. It's best to bathe the horse the night before so your horse is clean and ready to go.If you clean your horse before the night of the show, your horse could get dirty and you would have to clean them again. Beware of using shine-enhancing formula around the saddle area though, or you might run into the issue of a slipping saddle or saddle pad. Another benefit of bathing the horse the night before is that there is less time for them to roll about etc. to make themselves dirty again.  ", " Clip your horse. Clip the fetlocks  on your horse's legs closely, as well as the longer hairs that grow on your horse's muzzle, face, ears, and throat. Clip the hair that falls onto your horses hooves straight. Clipping is important! Always clip your horse a nice, clean bridle path - for stock horses, the length of the ear but for light breeds about an ear and a half. Clipping adds definition to your horse's body shape and improves the overall presentation before the judge. Do not trim your horses if they are heavy horses, such as Friesians or Clydesdales. If you're planning on a full-body clip, do so 1-2 weeks prior to the show. Clipping the entire body gives the coat a dull appearance until the oils are spread out again and the coat grows back a bit.   ", " Whiten any white socks or sections on your horse. A white horse or horse with socks that appears brown, grass-stained, or dingy won\u2019t score as well with judges. Use a whitening shampoo to thoroughly scrub all white areas on your horse, allowing it to set and soak in for about 5 minutes before rinsing it off. Then, coat white socks or stars with cornstarch or French chalk to keep the white looking white. If your horse gets their socks dirty before the show again, use baby powder to cover it up. Wrap white socks with standing wraps to keep your horse from dirtying and staining them before a show.  ", " Take care of your horse\u2019s mane and tail. Wash the mane and tail with a specialized shampoo, and use a whitening product if your horse\u2019s hair is white. Add in a detangler to make sure that there are no knots to get your comb caught on. Then, use a metal pull brush to thin out too-thick manes, or use a specialized mane razor to accomplish the task. Finish off by braiding or banding the mane and tail for the show. By braiding the mane and tail a few days in advance, even if you intend to have their mane and tail loose, it will keep it from getting tangled and add a lovely wave to the hair. If you\u2019re banding the mane, cut off excess hair after banding. This will help it to look more precise and avoid the need to cut it twice. Wrap the tail with a tail bag or long sock to keep it from coming undone or getting caught on anything.  "], "Packing for the Show": [" Prepare your horse's food and water. Because shows are often stressful areas for horses (with all the other horses and people present), it is important to try to keep as normal of a feed schedule as possible. Get all their regular food and at least two buckets for water. When you get to the show, try to feed them at the same times as you normally would at home. ", " Gather all your tack. The worse thing is showing up to a show missing some of the necessary tack and equipment that you will need. Make a checklist of everything you will need for the show, including any riding or exercise gear and blankets. Put all of these together and check them off your list prior to leaving, just to make sure you\u2019ve gotten everything you could possibly need. Clean and polish all tack before heading to the show for the best presentation. Check with your show circuit's regulations; some bits, aids and pieces of tack are prohibited. For example, 4-H has severe restrictions on the types of bits used, and some riding clubs or associations don't allow figure-eights, draw reins, etc.  ", " Get a trailer companion prepared, if necessary. Driving long distances in a trailer can be especially stressful for some horses. Rather than arriving at your show with a frightened, anxious horse, help to minimize their anxiety by bringing another horse along for the ride. They\u2019ll be much more calm upon arrival than if you hadn\u2019t. ", " Prepare the necessary stall equipment. Call the event venue that you are showing at, and see if you need to bring your own bedding for the stall. Many shows require that you bring your own shavings to fill the stall with, as well as any hooks or chains, and a wheelbarrow/bucket and pick for cleaning. See what will be available for communal use at the show and what you need to bring from home - and make sure what you\u2019re bringing meets any guidelines the venue may have. ", " Get a first aid kit prepared, for both horses and humans. No matter where you travel, it is always important to have a first aid kit prepared for your horse. Bring all basic supplies to treat for basic cuts and abrasions as well as bruises or swelling. Be sure to do the same with a human first aid kit, should you encounter an accident of some sort. ", " Bring a change of clothes. You\u2019ll be away from home, so it\u2019s best to prepare for everything and anything. Pack a spare set of show clothes in case something happens to your own, making them unusable for the show. Additionally, you could choose to pack a pair of more comfortable clothes/shoes for the ride to and from the venue. "], "Getting Yourself Ready": [" Dress for Western classes. For western competitions such as Western pleasure or Western horsemanship, always wear an outfit that makes your horse stand out and color coordinates with your saddle pad. This will add great style to your overall presentation. For a local show, a button up western shirt, nice show pants, boots, and a belt may be very acceptable. But for more competitive shows, everyone will be wearing more elaborate garments such as form fitting silkies and vests, expensive chaps, etc. If your budget will not allow you to make these purchases, as long as your outfit compliments yourself as well as your horse, then you have nothing to worry about. Dark colors on light horses, and lighter colors on dark horses tend to draw more attention to them. It's not recommended to wear an all-black outfit in the show ring. Most of your competition will also be wearing it and you will want to stand out among everyone else. A deep purple or midnight blue is a great alternative. If you are confident in your skills and the skills of your horse, try drawing a bit of extra attention with a brightly colored shirt is a good option. You will stand out in the crowd and be more memorable in a sea of similar colors.  ", " Dress for English classes. You should wear a dark and/or traditional coat (navy, black, hunter green, tan, gray, brown, or copper) and breeches that complement, generally a light neutral or white color. Your shirt should have a stock collar and pin or a ratcatcher collar. Your boots should be highly shined and your gloves should match your boots; black is the recommended color. Do not wear boots that have a high heels. The glove should successfully keep any bare flesh from being seen between your hands and the sleeve of your jacket. For saddle seat you need a full suit: day coat and matching pants with shined jodhpur boots and either a derby hat for the female riders, or a fedora for the male riders, that accents your outfit. Helmets for English classes should be a dark color (i.e. black, navy). Check the guidelines for your event to see what the specifics are.   ", " Do your hair properly. Always have your hair up, make sure to get all fly-aways before showing, unless you are showing hunter/jumper or dressage. For more competitive shows, all hair should absolutely be under your helmet, or tightly fastened into a neat bun in a hairnet at the back of your head, just barely below your hat or helmet. Often for younger children or for riders on ponies, braids with bows is considered to be more appropriate. "], "Preparing Day-of": [" Feed your horse. Overfeeding or underfeeding at an event is a surefire way to make your horse uncomfortable, and therefore less show-ready. Follow their regular diet plan, adjusting feeding around events if  necessary. Your horse will be happier and easier to work with after having eaten. ", " Do a final grooming. Don\u2019t bathe your horse, but brush them down really well to make their coat gleam. Spend the most time using the curry comb, and make sure to address all parts of their body. Spend extra time on white areas and apply more baby powder, corn starch, or French chalk if necessary. ", " Polish your horse\u2019s hooves. English and western riders often sand the horses hooves to make them smooth, then apply hoof polish. Black hoof polish can be applied on naturally black hooves, while clear polish should be applied to hooves any color other than black. This should all be done on a clean hard surface. Put down rubber or heavy foam mats on the ground in your grooming area, to allow the hoof black to dry. Once the hoof black is completely dry, dirt may be wiped off with a dry towel. If you don\u2019t want to polish your horses hooves, rub in some lanolin oil to add extra shine. Appaloosas are not permitted to use hoof polish of ANY color, other than clear, and even that is frowned upon. Check with your breed registry for specifications and regulations.  ", " Take time to relax. Shows and events are intended to be enjoyable; if you\u2019re nervous you will not only enjoy the event less, but your horse will mirror your emotions and you likely won\u2019t show as well. Make sure you've gotten enough sleep the night before, and enough to eat and drink before the competition. Do some deep breathing exercises and visualization to relax; listen to music or repeat a mantra if that helps you. Be sure to help your horse relax as well, going for a walk or lunge with them if necessary.  Don't worry about the other competitors. Act as if you were riding alone in your home arena. It will calm your nerves, and encourage you to pay attention to your own riding. Of course, be alert, and avoid running into the other riders in the ring.

Being an equestrian requires that you are a life-long learner of all things horse related. Never stop researching or asking questions. For example, if your horse reacts oddly to a certain harness, look up possible reasons online.   ", " Join an equestrian community. Making friends with fellow equestrians at your local barn is always a good idea. They can be excellent mentors for you. Being an equestrian is not a solo activity and you will require the assistance of many people in order to be a success. You can also get involved in equestrian communities online, especially by participating in one of the many horse blog networks.  If you own a horse and choose to board it, your fellow riders at the boarding stable will become your community. To find a good boarding stable, search online for boarding and training facilities by state. You will want to choose a stable close to your home to make visiting easier. Visit your stable options to assess their cleanliness and general atmosphere.  You can also build a community by going to a stable for riding lessons. In this case, you will want to very carefully choose your riding instructor. Make sure that they are a member of the Certified Horsemanship Association (CHA). Request references and ask questions about their experience level as well. To keep the conversation going, before you head to the barn each day, think about a few questions to ask other riders. For example, you might say, \u201cHow long should I cool down my horse after a one hour work-out?\u201d  ", " Spend time around horses. Take lessons at a local barn or volunteer to help out at a non-profit stable. If a neighbor owns horses, offer to help them out. You want to spend as many contact hours around horses as possible. Doing so will make you attuned to their behaviors and will help you hone your caretaking and horsemanship skills. For true equestrians, riding is only part of the experience. You will also need to get your hands dirty mucking stalls, grooming, and feeding/watering. Don\u2019t shirk these responsibilities or other riders will not take you seriously. It is great to own a horse, but make sure that you have contact with other horses as well. Expose yourself to different horse personalities and alternative skill sets. For example, if you are interested in barrel racing, both you and your horse would benefit from spending time with an experienced racing team.  ", " Pay careful attention to the physical and mental needs of horses. As an equestrian, you are responsible for the well-being of the horses around you. Make a daily, weekly, and monthly calendar in which you note major health appointments. Use this calendar to also keep track of how much, and what items, you feed your horse every day. And, keep an eye out for your horse\u2019s mental status. If your horse begins to act out violently or is really lethargic, it may need some extra attention or even a change of stall. Treating all health concerns seriously is important for the horse, but also for your safety. Animals in pain are more likely to lash out, injuring their caretakers in the process. Get to know all of the equine professionals who care for horses, including veterinarians and farriers. Vets take care of a horse\u2019s vaccinations and dental work while farriers watch over a horse\u2019s all-important hoof care. Horses will often take a wide variety of supplements and vitamins. It is important to note what a horse takes in so that you can trace its outward effects.  ", " Respect the animals that you work with. No matter whether you are riding your personal horse or a shared barn horse, you need to treat all animals with the respect that they deserve. Keep calm when working with them and never act out of violence. Count to five if you get frustrated and try the same action once again. Take note of the physical strength and size of a horse as well. They can hurt you without even meaning to if you aren\u2019t careful. For example, when you walk beside a horse, watch the placement of your feet. If a horse steps on your foot it can lead to bruises and even fractures.   ", " Serve as an apprentice. Some local horse programs offer formal apprenticeship programs. However, you can usually arrange your own. Find a trainer or horse professional who you admire and feel comfortable working with. Tell them about your interests and ask them to teach you everything that they know. In return, offer to help them care for the horses.  When you are a more experienced equestrian, make sure that you return this favor by accepting apprentices yourself. Or, even less formally, act like a mentor to younger riders.

Start incorporating core-strengthening exercises, such as the wood-chopper and plank, into your regular routine. You will be able to ride longer with fewer sore muscles as a result.  Remember that riding a horse is excellent exercise, but does not include weight resistance. So, it may help you to develop muscles, but will not build bone density.  If you want an exercise boost, muck out a stall. It provides both cardio and weight resistance.  ", " Get access to a horse. Spending time caring for a horse and working on your riding skills is a necessary part of becoming an equestrian.

Select equestrian programs at the college level will provide access to a stable of pre-selected horses. If you are interested in joining a collegiate equestrian team, look into this option.  ", " Choose a type of riding. Eighteen styles of riding are currently regulated by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF). You can focus on western style reining (executing precision loops with your reins while horseback) or even vaulting (holding on to a modified saddle while performing gymnastic moves) or countless other options. Ask your mentors and peers for information, watch equestrian events, and read all that you can about the various sports.  The standard Olympic equestrian events are: dressage, show jumping, and eventing. Dressage is essentially dancing in sync with your horse. Show jumping involves a horse and rider jumping over various obstacles on a course. And eventing is a combination sport requiring endurance and jumping on untamed terrain.  Western style riding requires that the horse and rider navigate a variety of obstacles and demonstrate proficiency in corralling. Western dressage riding places an emphasis on a smooth gait and clear communication between horse and rider. Western reining is judged on control during the demonstration of reining patterns.  Other styles of riding include hunter, which mimics the process of a hunter pursuing prey on horseback, and English pleasure style, which places an emphasis on smooth transitions. You can even focus on carriage pleasure driving, which takes into account a driver\u2019s skill in managing a team or single horse.   ", " Wear the right equipment. Many of your equipment choices will coincide with your sport. Take equipment recommendations from your mentor or other equestrians. If you plan to participate in competitions, make sure to read the guidelines carefully or you could face disqualification or point penalties. Remember to invest in a quality helmet. It needs certifications from both the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI). If you choose to ride competitively and/or often, it is also a good idea to buy a body protector. You wear this vest over your torso and it helps to absorb the energy from a fall or kick. Many different models are available online. You will also want to wear some sort of leather shoe, preferably with a small heel. Riding boots are standard for many equestrian sports, although western riders often go with cowboy boots.  You can purchase riding gloves online or at a local tack shop. Gloves are especially useful in the winter and are also required for some equestrian sports.  Here is an example of sport-specific dress: General Western style riders prefer leather chaps, cowboy hats, and brightly colored western-themed shirts. Western dressage riders often wear themed-riding jackets as well. In addition to the above, Western reining riders must wear a collared shirt and necktie.  For safety reasons, try to remove most of your jewelry. If your hair is long, tie it back and secure it under your helmet.   ", " Practice, practice, practice. As often as you can, get out with a horse and practice your intended sport. Do repetitions of the same action so that it becomes second nature for you both. Look for weaknesses and target those areas in particular. For example, some barrel horses don\u2019t like turning left, so it is all the more important to practice that direction. It is best to practice at least once a week with a trainer who has experience in your specific sport. If you belong to an equestrian team, it is possible that you will have group lessons as well as individual ones. In addition to working out with a trainer, you should practice at least 2-3 times a week on your own. This is yet another reason to choose a stable near your home.  ", " Learn from other equestrians. Go to equestrian competitions and cheer for your peers. Go the barns afterwards and talk with the riders and their helpers. If you are unable to travel to competitions, watch them on TV or stream them live online.  "], "Living as an Equestrian": [" Do what you enjoy the most. Sit down and do some serious thinking about what you like about horses. Do you enjoy a particular sport? Or, do you find the most happiness out of training horses? Perhaps you really like treating horses for illness? Not all equestrians are the same and you don\u2019t have to compete to be an equestrian. Equestrians love horses and live a horse-centered lifestyle.

Seek the advice of other trusted equestrians as you make this decision.  ", " Acknowledge the time requirements. Horses require a great deal of care. They will interrupt your daily schedule and will demand attention even on holidays. Look over your daily calendar and consider realistically how much time you have to devote to an equestrian lifestyle. This is an especially important to consider if you are thinking about becoming a horse owner. Horses are social creatures and don\u2019t do well cooped up in a stall without visits for long periods of time. This can seriously damage your relationship with your horse and may even put you in danger while riding.  ", " Consider your personal finances. Evaluate what monies you have available to devote to your equestrian pursuits. Being an equestrian can be quite expensive, depending on your specific interests, so you want to be realistic early on. For example, certain sports such as dressage require advanced training that can be rather costly. If you are on a limited budget, all is not lost.

Course layouts are usually released the day of the show jumping event so riders don\u2019t have much time to prepare. Take a picture of the overhead layout that\u2019s posted as well as the actual course. Use the pictures as a reference so you can learn the order of the jumps and how they\u2019re laid out in relation to one another.  Try to get pictures of the course from as many angles as you can so you can learn it better.   ", " Draw the path you\u2019ll take to hit all of the jumps. Use your finger to trace the path over the picture you took. Follow the numbers and arrows on the obstacles so you know the order you need to complete them in. Refer to the text on the course layout to see what obstacles are included or excluded from your run.  Look for apps available on Apple or Android, like Jump Off and CourseTool, that allow you to upload the picture of the course layout.

If you\u2019re lucky, you may have an opportunity to watch other riders go through the course before you. Pay attention to how they make their turns and the obstacles that they\u2019re jumping in order. That way, you can get an idea of how you should plot your path when it\u2019s your turn.  Sit in different locations so you can see the course ran from all angles.  ", " Walk the course before you have to run it. Before it\u2019s your turn to run the course, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to walk through it at least once. Count your strides so you know how far the obstacles are separated from one another. Then you can plan how you\u2019ll run them while you\u2019re on your horse. As you walk, pay attention to the obstacle numbers and colors so you can remember them when it\u2019s your turn.  Some events will let you walk through the course multiple times so you can focus on the terrain and other strategies to use to get the fastest time. Carry a picture of the course layout with you while you walk it so you can locate the next jumps easily.  "], "Using Memorization Techniques": [" Find lines between jumps instead of memorizing each one individually. Memorize paths between jumps that are in line with one another rather than trying to remember individual jumps. For example, If you have 2 or 3 jumps in a row, think about the direction you need to go, such as a diagonal line toward the corner. Grouping the jumps together reduces the amount you have to memorize and makes it easier to remember.  Aim to cut the amount you have to memorize by half. For example, if there are 12 jumps on the course, try to memorize them as 6 paths you need to take.  ", " Use word associations to remember the path you want to take. Think of rhymes or alliterations you can use so you know what movements you need to make as you go through the course. Coming up with clever phrases can help you make an association with the obstacle so it\u2019s easier to recall while you\u2019re making your run.  For example, you may say something like, \u201cStay right a smidge after the bridge\u201d to help you remember how to turn your horse or, \u201cLope left after logs\u201d so you don\u2019t forget to change speeds. Put your rhymes to a simple tune so you can recite the lines easily. For example, you could use the tune of \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using your own rhymes.  ", " Remember the colors of the obstacles. Write down the colors of the poles on each jump so you can use them as a memorization device. Rather than trying to remember the individual jumps and numbers, think of their colors in order so you can recall them later on. Without looking at the course, list the colors out loud so you can memorize them.  ", " Try working through your route backward. Choose one of the last jumps on the course and recite the path you\u2019re going to take from there. When you reach the end of the course, go back to the jump before the one you started on and run through the course again. This can make it easier to remember the middle of the course rather than always rehearsing from the beginning.  ", " Ask a friend to quiz you on the route you\u2019re going to take. Give the picture of the course to a friend or family member and have them ask you which path you\u2019re taking. Recite the jumps in order using the memorization techniques you\u2019ve used.

Although there are some similarities among different breeds of horses, each breed has its own ideal qualities. Find out as much as you can about the breed you will be judging to ensure that you know what to look for. You can also check with the horse's breeding association for a judging manual.  For example, if you are judging American Quarterhorses, then you would need to note the prominence of the horse's withers. Prominent withers are a sign of a well-balanced American Quarterhorse.  If you are looking at Hunter in Hand horses, then a longer, leaner, more angular build would be desirable. The ideal Arabian has a high, arched neck that joins with high withers, and long, sloping shoulders. Morgan horses are known for their high, angular shoulders that blend into a short back and the neck almost looks as though it is on top of the withers, rather than coming out of them.    ", " Look for equal lengths of the horse's shoulder, back, and hip. Stand beside the horse about 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) away so that you can see the horse's profile. If these 3 areas appear to be equal in length, then the horse has a balanced conformation. If 1 area is shorter or longer than the rest, then you would deduct points for this imbalance.  You can describe the horse's balance conformation by saying something like, \u201cShowed more balance with smooth, symmetrical parts,\u201d or \u201cLacked overall balance and symmetry of parts.\u201d   ", " Ensure that the face is no longer than the shoulder, back, and hip. The face starts at the top of the horse's head where it begins to slope downwards and goes to the tip of its nose. Compare the length to the length of the sections of the horse's body you just evaluated. The horse's face should be equal in length to these other sections.  If the face appears longer, or shorter than these sections, then the horse is not well-balanced. Note the appearance of the face with something like, \u201cFace in proportion to other parts,\u201d or \u201cFace is out of proportion to other parts.\u201d   ", " See if the top of the neck is twice as long as the bottom of the neck. Still looking at the horse from the side, compare the top part of its neck to the bottom or underside of its neck. In a well-balanced horse, the top part of the horse's neck should be 2 times the length of the bottom part of the neck.  If the top part of the neck is less than 2 times longer than the bottom of the neck, then this would mean the horse is unbalanced. Describe the neck by saying something like, \u201cLonger neck,\u201d or \u201cShorter neck.\u201d   ", " Check to see if the back of the horse is shorter than its underline. Identify the horse's back, which is the section between the withers and flank. Then, look at the horse's underline, which is the section of its stomach between its legs. In a well-balanced horse, the back should be shorter than the underline.  If the back is equal to or longer than the underline, the horse is not well-balanced.

Walk around to the front side of the horse and look at it from about 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) away. Look at the area in the center of the horse's chest and see if there are any visible muscles. You should notice a deep V between the pectoral muscles if the horse is well-muscled.  If there is no V or if you cannot see visible muscles, then the horse is not well-muscled. You can use terms like, \u201cFull-chested,\u201d or \u201cflat-chested\u201d to describe the horse's pectorals.   ", " Identify the horse's visible muscles from a side view. Walk around to the side of the horse again, and check for muscling in the horse's shoulder, forearm, loin, and hindquarter. These should be easily visible from a distance of about 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m).  If you cannot see any muscles from the side, then the horse is not well-muscled.

The stifle is the width of the horse's buttocks when you view the horse from behind. Stay 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) back from the horse for safety and look at the horse's stifle. Compare the width of the stifle to the hips, which are about 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) above the stifle. The stifle should be noticeably wider than the hips in a well-muscled horse.  If the stifle is equal to the hips, then the horse is not well-muscled. You can describe the stifle by adding a statement like, \u201cMore muscling at the stifle,\u201d or \u201cLess muscling at the stifle.\u201d   ", " Note the angle of the shoulder and whether it is 45 degrees. A 45 degree angle is desirable in a horse's neck. Walk back around to your position about 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) away from the side of the horse and look at its shoulder from this position.  If the angle of the horse's neck is less than a 45 degrees, then its structure is off and this will affect its stride. Try describing the angle of the neck by saying something like, \u201cMore correct angle at the neck,\u201d or \u201cLess correct angle at the neck.\u201d   ", " Look for square-shaped hips. Still viewing the horse from the side, look at its hips. The hips should look square. Imagine drawing a square over the horse's hips to help you visualize this. If the hips would not fit within a square, then they are likely rounded, which is not ideal.

Be sure to get a look at the horse from the side and back to carefully evaluate the horse's gait. When viewing the horse from the side, the horse should take long strides using the front and back legs equally. When viewing the horse from behind, you should notice that it is moving in a straight line and that it does not deviate to 1 side as it travels.  You may also need to watch the horse trot, gallop, or run depending on the breed or competition. Keep in mind that there might be some variation in the ideal stride based on the horse's breed. For example, if you are judging an Arabian, Morgan, or Saddlebreed, then more flexion in the hocks and knees is desirable. However, for stock and hunter breeds, less flexion is the norm.  Describe the specific features of the horse's gait in your evaluation, such as by saying, \u201cLonger, truer stride\u201d for a horse that takes long strides and moves in a straight line. Or, simply say something like, \u201cDid not travel straight\u201d if the horse deviates to 1 side as it moves.   ", " Check the horse's body for a thick, glossy coat. The horse's coat should look shiny and healthy. Walk around the horse to check the coat on all sides, or note the appearance of the coat as you watch it walk.  If the horse has any bare or scant patches on its body or if its coat appears dull, then this would be important to note in your evaluation.

For example, if your event consists of jumps and barrel runs, work on the jumps for the first 10 minutes of your session, take a small walking break, and then return to the jumps. The next session, work on barrel runs.  ", " Run through the routine 3 times per week the month before the show. Once you've practiced each part of the routine individually, it's time to put things together. Start acclimating your horse to the full routine by putting it through its paces several times a week. This will help you cut down on timing and identify any problem areas you need to address before the show.  The more you practice the event in the order it'll happen, the more comfortable you and your horse will be on the day of the competition.  ", " Practice problem areas with your horse to get them ready. When you notice there is an area you aren't quite getting, try slowing things down (if you can). For example, if your horse continually knocks into barrels or posts, which can often detract points from your total score, try practicing the routine at a slower pace.  It can be really helpful to have someone video you when you're doing a run-through. Watch the video of yourself and take notes of things you need to work on, from your own posture and presence to any clumsy or hesitant movements.  ", " Visualize yourself succeeding and stay positive. A big part of success is keeping a positive outlook. You've been putting in the time to practice for your event, so focus on the good you and your horse have accomplished in your training. You'll feel much better going into the competition, which in turn will make you more relaxed and likely to succeed.  Your horse can pick up on your energy, so it's also important that you stay calm. Use reassuring words and an even, warm tone when you speak with your horse, and make sure to reward them when they do things right.

If you don't have your own trailer, you'll need to rent or borrow one for the duration of the event.  ", " Groom your horse thoroughly several days before the show. Give your horse a full-body bath and wash its mane and tail. Clip your horse's legs (you may even want to do this a full week before the show), face, and ears. Clean, buff, and polish its hooves, and apply a conditioner to its mane and tail. You'll still do last-minute grooming at the horse show, but this will be a great start to getting your horse ready.  Look into dust-repellent products if you're going to be competing in a dry, dusty environment. You can also hire a professional groomer to come out and give your horse a once-over a few days before the event.  ", " Pack your bag and your horse's gear the day before you leave. Get out that list you made earlier and start packing up your gear. This is also the time to iron your clothes and make sure everything is clean and in good working order. If you're staying at a hotel overnight, pack a separate bag with whatever toiletries and clothes you need so that you don't have to unpack all your gear to get to it.  Ask for help from family or friends if you need an extra pair of hands to get ready in time. Plus, it might make the packing process a little more fun!  ", " Leave extra time for unexpected things on your travel day. Plan to arrive at the facility the day before your event if you can. If not, at least leave several extra hours between your arrival time and show time. If you're able to, give yourself a big buffer so that you can deal with anything unexpected, like needing to stop at the store or deal with a flat tire.  If you're traveling with others, set an agreed-upon time for everyone to meet up at a designated spot.

Your horse should eat and drink 2 to 3 hours before the event. If you arrive earlier than that, keep your horse on its regular feeding schedule, and then give it another chance to eat at that 2 to 3-hour mark.  If this is your horse's first event, it can be an overwhelming time. Walk them around a little bit to get a sense of the space. This can also help you get rid of some pre-event jitters.  ", " Warm up an hour or two before your event starts. There should be a schooling ring available for you to warm up in that is next to the arena where your event will be. This is an important time for you and your horse to start gearing up for the main event. Walk, trot, and canter around a little, and do some light jumps if that is something you're comfortable with.  Make sure to take a few minutes to stretch your body, too. You'll feel more limber and relaxed as you head into the event.  ", " Brush down your horse and make sure its ready for the event. The last hour before the show, get dressed, deal with your own personal grooming, and then address your horse. Make sure its hooves are clean, give it a final brush down, and tidy up its mane and tail if any hairs are out of place. You may also want to apply a shine-coat last minute so it looks pristine as you get ready to head out to the arena.  Presentation is often a big component of events. Judges will mark you down for sloppy clothes or a poorly-groomed horse.  ", " Stay focused on the tasks at hand and avoid distractions. You may be tempted to watch the people you're competing against or to look at the judges, but try and just focus on what you're meant to be doing. Remember your training, and commit to doing your very best when you get out into the arena.  Even if you make a mistake, that doesn't mean you won't win. Recover from whatever happens, move on to the next moment, and treat it as a new opportunity to succeed.  ", " Have fun, enjoy yourself, and learn from the process. Hopefully, you'll be celebrating at the end of the event when you win! Be gracious to others around you, and compliment the other riders and horses. After you get home from the event, take a few moments to write down what went well and what will help you continue succeeding in the future.

"]}}, "How to Campdraft With Your Horse": {"description": "Campdrafting is a uniquely Australian horse sport that puts the skills of both horse and rider to the test and is a great test of how good a cattleman you truly are. Campdrafting involves two main stages firstly \"The Camp\" or cutout yard where the rider selects his beast, separates it from a mob and works it, and \"The Course\" or arena, where the rider guides his beast in a pattern. Campdrafts are judged by a single judge on horseback. Instead of a whistle to signal disqualification of the end of a run, the judge will crack a stock whip, if the stock whip is cracked you are disqualified (cracked off).", "content": {"Steps": [" Before you even think about beginning to campdraft, you need to ensure that both you and your horse are up to the job. Riders need to be very competent and confident and should have some experience working cattle. A horse will preferably have had experience working cattle. Horses should have the ability to turn on their back legs, stop and start quickly similarly to a cutting horse. Indeed, many cutting horses, or, more commonly cutting bred horses, often make fine campdrafters, providing they have the speed to keep up with a beast in the arena. The most common breed used for campdrafting is the Australian Stock horse, closely followed by the Quarter horse, however almost any smart horse with a bit of cattle sense can make a campdrafter.  ", " If you have never seen a campdraft before, it is probably a good idea to go for a look first. Many small towns in Australia run a campdraft at least once a year and there are campdraft exhibitions at all the major royal shows. Campdraft calendars can be accessed at the following sites-<www.abcra.com.au> (Australian bushman's campdraft and rodeo assn.), <www.campdraft.org.au> (Southern Campdrafting assn.), <www.campdraft.com.au> (Australian campdraft assn.), <www.campdraft.com.au> (Australian campdraft assn.), NB- As these sites are different associations they all have different campdrafts. ", " Go to a small campdraft first. So, you're all set, you've got an idea what to do and you're at your first draft. It's probably best if you go to a small local one for your first time. The competitors will tend to be more friendly and it is a lot more fun, even if the cattle are often more difficult. ", " Like any sport, you will need to warm your horse up before you run. If you have time, you should take at least half an hour to do this, and longer if your horse is unused to the atmosphere. Once the initial warming up is done, a great place to work your horse is in the arena, returning cattle that have already been run into holding pens. Everyone is usually welcome to help out but it can get crowded in the mid morning before the weather is too hot. This is great to get your horse on cattle and to get him used to the atmosphere. ", " Once you and your suitably warmed up horse are ready, you should head to the camp. How long you spend here is personal preference. Some people arrive half an hour before their run, others arrive just as they are about to go in. My personal preference is to arrive 10 runs before mine, to give both you and your horse ample time to relax and for you to pick a beast. ", " Pick the right horse. Picking a beast is probably one of the hardest parts of drafting. Often this is a personal preference, with people choosing a certain breed of cattle or maybe heifers or steers. A general rule of thumb is to pick the beast you would want to take home to slaughter. You don't want a little mouldy beast as the smaller ones can run very fast and are often dangerous. A beast that is over fat is likely to knock up outside and prevent you from completing the course. You want a beast that turns away from the horse and rider (but does so calmly- the beast that bolts away will do just that outside), is alert and not in amongst the mob. in an ideal world this is what you would pick. also, never be afraid to ask, most campdrafters are more than happy to help a newbie. ", " OK, so you've picked your beast and the announcer has just called your name.  RELAX . If you get tense, so will your horse, and you WILL stuff up. Ride in with one hand on your waist to relax you. If the judge isn't looking, you can ride amongst the mob to help chose a beast, just be careful not to start working until he says go. ", " Start when you are told to and not before. The judge will tell you to start when the previous competitor's beast is off the course. Usually he will call out to you to start, or it may simply be a nod. Either way, be ready when he says go. There is nothing more infuriating than someone trying to pick a beast when the judge is waiting. Shorten your reins, using two hands and calmly try to cut your beast from the mob. If he is on his own you can simply ride up to him and push him down the camp. You may need to bring more than one beast up the front. This is OK, but should be avoided. It looks bad and it works your horse up. Once your beast is separated you need to turn it about 2-3 times at the front of the camp. Once you become more experienced you can get a bit more 'fancy' but for your first little while its best to keep it simple. ", " You have finished your yard work, you need to call out for the gate at the front of the camp to be opened. Yell out \"GATE\" or \"RIGHT\" or whatever else, just make it loud and clear as the gatemen are more than likely chatting or half asleep. ", " Now is the scary part. You are outside in the arena. For the purpose of this we will assume it is a left hand course (the judge will tell you if the course is left or right hand). Your aim is to turn the beast around the first peg , then bring him round in a figure 8 and go round the second peg before going through the \"Gate\" (two pegs\"). The whole course is similar to a barrel course. Use common sense to turn the beast. If you want him to turn a gradual left, hang back about the length of one beast back and one out from his head, on his right hand side. If he turns to quick, change sides to correct him. Sometimes it is necessary to \"Shoulder\" the beast, or push him with your horse's shoulder. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNLESS YOU AND YOUR HORSE ARE VERY EXPERIENCED. This is one of the major causes of accidents. ", " HAVE FUN. Remember, you are not doing this to make money. If you win that's a bonus, if you get the whip in the camp then bad luck, try again next time. Don't lose heart. If you stick at it long enough you will get there.
