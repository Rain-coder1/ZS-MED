If you want to know the traditional contents of each sub, you can either ask the sandwich artist or consult a menu. If you\u2019re getting turkey, ask to upgrade it to the Subway carved turkey.

It's the exact same materials you need to make a classic P&J (just without the peanut butter): one to two slices of bread, flavor jelly of choice, a butter knife to spread the jelly, and a plate and napkin to eat it once it's done. Place the bread on the plate. One piece will make a quicker, smaller sandwich, while two pieces will make a larger, more filling one.   ", " Prepare your jelly.  Most kinds of jelly come in a jar. In order to open it, grab the lid and twist. For other kinds that may come in a bottle, you just flip open the lid and squeeze out your jelly. At this point you need to place the jelly on the bread. If it's in a jar, you may need to use the butter knife to get it out. Just leave it in a little heap in the center of the bread for now, making sure you have a good jelly to bread ratio.  ", " Spread the jelly.  Using the butter knife, spread the jelly as evenly as possible over each slice of bread. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you don't want too much jelly all in one bite. Try to spread outwards from the center of the bread for the best results. This step can sometimes get a bit messy. If you get any jelly on your hands or on the crust of the bread, you can wipe it up with your napkin.  ", " Finish up your sandwich.  If you are making your jelly sandwich with two slices of bread, place one of the pieces of bread on top of the other, making the sides with jelly meet. Try to align the crusts of the bread so that no jelly leaks out. If you are making your jelly sandwich with one piece of bread, you can finish it off in two ways.  The first is to break the bread in half, then place one half on top of the other so that the sides with jelly meet. You want to align the two halves just like above. This method words best with harder bread. The second is to fold the bread in half, aligning the sides with the jelly. This method works best with softer bread, as harder bread may crumble when folded. The only thing left to do is enjoy your edible masterpiece!

Don't knock it until you've tried it \u2014 this treat makes a great companion to tea and is just as good on its own as a low-calorie snack. Learn the traditional English recipe for the sandwich along with a few basic recipe variations to keep your meals interesting.", "content": {"Basic Cucumber Sandwich": [" Peel and slice a fresh, washed cucumber. Traditionally, cucumber sandwiches use thin, crisp slices of cucumber with the dark green peel removed. Use a potato peeler or a small, sharp knife to shave off the peel. You can use thick slices or leave the peel on if you wish \u2014 it's up to you. The peel won't hurt you, but its texture is slightly tougher than the flesh of the cucumber.   ", " Drain the liquid from the cucumber slices. Drop the slices into a colander in the sink. Let them drain for about 10 minutes, then remove them to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel. Getting your cucumber slices as crisp and dry (on the outside) as possible is important for a good sandwich. Soft, wet slices of cucumber are exactly what you want \u2014 they'll leave you with a dull, soggy mess.  ", " Make your cream cheese spread. In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, mayonnaise, garlic powder, and onion salt. Stir well until smooth and uniform. ", " Spread the cream cheese mixture on both pieces of bread. You can be as generous as you like with the spread. One of the nice things about putting the spread on both pieces of bread is that it traps the moisture from the cucumber slices in the middle of the sandwich so that they don't make the bread soggy. This is something you can do with many fat or oil-based spreads (like peanut butter).   ", " Sandwich the cucumbers between the bread slices. Lay down a few slices of cucumber on one of the pieces of bread. You can be generous here \u2014 you want a little cucumber in every bite. When you're done, lay the other piece of bread on top (spread facing down, of course). Congratulations \u2014 you just made your first cucumber sandwich!  ", " Remove the crusts and cut the sandwich into small pieces. There's no \"wrong\" way to eat a cucumber sandwich, but in England, the sandwich is often eaten in small, crust-less squares, triangles, or fingers. Cut the sandwich how you wish (or leave it how it is) and serve immediately.  If you're serving guests, repeat the steps above for more sandwiches, working through your loaf of bread. If needed, make more spread or cut more cucumber slices. In the section below, you'll learn a few tips for \"spicing up\" the basic cucumber sandwich recipe. Use these variations as you wish \u2014 you may even want to try serving a platter with every different kind of sandwich for variety's sake.  "], "Recipe Variations": [" Sprinkle dill over the cucumbers for a subtly fresh flavor. Dill pairs excellently with the smooth, subdued flavors of a typical cucumber sandwich. After all, it's a crucial ingredient in dill pickles (which are made from cucumbers). A pinch or two of dried dill sprinkled into the sandwich will add some of this unique pickle-y flavor to the dish. For an eye-catching presentation, try serving the sandwiches open-faced (without the top piece of bread) and laying a single sprig of fresh dill across the cucumber slices. It'll look gorgeous (and taste great, too).  ", " Use lemon pepper for a tangy twist. With their crisp, cool taste and texture, cucumber sandwiches are the perfect summertime snack. Adding a little lemon pepper to the spread or sprinkling it over the cucumber slices gives your sandwiches just a hint of sourness, making them even more refreshing. Lemon pepper can be bought for fairly cheap at most mid- to high-end grocery stores. You can also make it yourself from lemon zest, salt, and pepper.   ", " Add Italian-style salad dressing for savory flavor. If the standard cucumber sandwich doesn't have enough flavor for you, try adding a splash of your favorite Italian salad dressing as you're mixing the spread. This will give it a slightly more savory, substantial flavor without ruining the overall smoothness that makes a cucumber sandwich so great. ", " Use pumpernickel rye bread for a traditional combination. Cucumber sandwiches are great with any good-quality white or wheat bread, but for an old-fashioned taste, use pumpernickel rye. Its heavy, sweet flavor contrasts well with the light, crisp bitterness of the cucumbers and the smoothness of the spread. Rye breads aren't always sold at neighborhood grocery stores, but you should be able to find it at many higher-end locations.  ", " Try with chopped mint for added coolness. Cucumbers are cool and crisp on their own, but with the added flavor and aroma of fresh mint, they're practically ice cold. Chop a few sprigs of mint and sprinkle them over the cucumbers or add them on top of each sandwich as a garnish. If you can, chop the mint into small, fine pieces. It's a little difficult to chew through whole mint leaves when they're in the middle of a sandwich.  ", " Try the sandwich with Marmite spread (if you're bold). Marmite is an infamous, strong-flavored spread made from yeast extract that is popular in the U.K. and some Commonwealth countries. Some people love it and some people hate it \u2014 it doesn't leave many tasters without a strong opinion. People who enjoy Marmite have been known to add it to cucumber sandwiches. If you want to try it but you've never had Marmite before, using a small amount is recommended. Marmite is often described as having a very salty taste with fishy qualities. It also has a strong odor that, to some, is unappealing.

Incorporate some nutritious wraps into your meal plan for a fun and creative twist on your meals.", "content": {"Choosing Nutritious Ingredients": [" Select your type of wrap. When you're making a wrap, there are a variety of items you can use to wrap up your tasty ingredients.  Try to keep calories to 100 \u2013 180 calories per item so your entire wrap doesn't get too high in calories. Mix it up and experiment with all the different ways you can wrap your food. You can try: Tortillas or wraps.  These are the traditional wraps used in these types of recipes.  They are very thin bread generally made from either corn or wheat.  Try to go for 100% whole wheat or whole grain as these tortillas/wraps will have more fiber and protein.  Flatbreads or lavash bread.  Both of these are similar to tortillas, but may be slightly larger or thicker.  Again, choose 100% whole wheat or whole grain items. Pita bread.  Pita bread can not only be stuffed with ingredients, but can also be used to wrap items too.  Whole grain is the preferable choice here as well. Lettuce.  If you're looking to watch calories or your total carbs, consider using lettuce as a wrap.  It's crunchy and naturally low in calories and carb-free. Try butter lettuce, iceberg lettuce, kale, Swiss chard or romaine lettuces. Spring roll wrappers. These are also low in calories and carbohydrates. It may take some practice to use them, but they offer a fun twist on your traditional wrap. Seaweed.  Just like with sushi, you can use sheets of seaweed as a wrap too.

Don't waste more than 50 calories on the total amount of condiments you add to your wrap; however, adding a ton of high fat condiments, sauces or dressings will defeat the purpose.  Stick to lower calorie condiments like: Mustard.  There are tons of flavors of mustard \u2014 spicy, yellow, dijon \u2014 but all are naturally low in calories. Mustard is high in sodium, however, so look for low-sodium options. Go for 1 \u2013 2 tablespoons. Mayo with olive oil.  Although mayo gets a bad rap about being high in calories and fat, try the mayo made with olive oil.  It's lower in calories than regular mayo and has some heart healthy fats.  Use 1 \u2013 2 tablespoons (29.6\u00a0ml).  Hummus.

Plus, it'll help keep you feeling satisfied throughout the day.  Choose a lean protein to add to your wrap to manage your overall calories. You can try: Poultry and red meat.

Choose three to four slices of deli meat or a piece of meat the size of your palm. Scrambled eggs.  If you're feeling like a little breakfast, try adding scrambled or hard boiled eggs to your wrap.  They're high in protein and healthy fats.  One to two eggs will meet your 3-4 oz serving size.  Sliced cheese.  If you're avoiding meat or just want to change it up a bit, try adding some sliced cheese to your wrap.  It's another great source of protein and also high in calcium.  Aim for two to three slices.  Beans or lentils.  If you want to skip the meat, try filling your wrap with 1/2 cup of beans or lentils.  They're not only high in protein, but also high in fiber.  Tofu or tempeh.  Another great vegetarian source of protein is tofu and tempeh.  Both made from soy beans, they're a great alternative to meat.  Slice up 3 \u2013 4 oz or a block about the size of your palm. Seafood.  Besides tuna salad, you can add grilled fish or seafood to your wrap.  They're still high in protein and some seafood (like salmon) are also high in heart healthy fats.  Measure out 1/2 cup of tuna salad or 3-4 oz.   ", " Add in some vegetables. It's important to get an adequate amount of vegetables in each day.  By stuffing in 1 cup of these nutrient powerhouse veggies to your wrap, you can help meet your daily goal of four to six servings. Try: Salad.  Wrap up a Greek, Cobb or Caesar salad in your wrap. Sliced raw veggies.  Vegetables can be bulky.  Slicing them into thin strips helps them fit evenly in your wrap. Roasted vegetables.

The one downside to packing lunches is the possibility of opening up your lunch to find a soggy sandwich or wrap.  Experiment with these tricks to keep your sandwich crunchy and fresh: Pack your wrap components separately.  If you're unsure of how to keep your wrap from getting soggy, pack everything separate.  This is a sure way to keep your ingredients fresh and crunchy.  Put juicy or \"wet\" ingredients in the center.  Put juicy tomatoes, pickles or marinated proteins in the center of your wrap.  You may want to consider sandwiching them between lettuce leaves to keep their moisture contained.  Mayo is higher in fat and can keep your wrap from getting super soggy; however, other condiments \u2014 like dressings or vinaigrettes \u2014 can make your wrap soggy.  Use very little or consider keeping them on the side if possible.  ", " Roll your wrap tightly in tin foil or plastic wrap. If you're packing your wrap to-go, make sure you tightly wrap it up so it stays in a formed roll and the ingredients do not spill out. Plastic wrap is a great tool to use.  You can keep your wrap fresh and tightly rolled together by fitting the plastic wrap snugly around your wrap. Aluminum foil is another material that you can use to keep your wrap contained.  Foil is especially good if you're keeping your wrap warmed. Parchment paper also works well.  But you'll need to secure the ends with some tape to make sure it doesn't unfold in your lunch box.  ", " Keep your wrap cold. If you're bringing your wrap to work or packing it up for a picnic, it's important to make sure that it stays cold.  If your wrap, or any food, gets too warm and stays warm, you could get sick.  If your wrap contains meat, vegetables, salads (made with mayonnaise) you'll want to keep the temperature under 40\u00b0F (4.4\u00b0C)if possible.  If it remains between 40 \u2013 140\u00b0F  (4.4 \u2013 60\u00b0C), this is the \"danger zone\" where bacteria can grow.  Include at least two cold sources when packing your wrap.  You can pack in two freezer packs or a freezer pack and a bottle of frozen water.  Refrigerate your wrap as soon as you're able or make sure to plan on eating it before your cold sources melt or get too warm. Foods that do not need refrigeration are whole fruits and vegetables, peanut butter, unopened canned tuna or chicken, pickles, mustard and hard cheese.

Depending on what combination you choose, your sandwich could end up being high in calories, fat, sugar, sodium, and carbohydrates; however, if you choose lower-calorie, more nutritious breads, wraps and fillings, you can end up with a much more healthy sandwich.  Make small changes to your what you currently choose for your sandwiches to make a better meal.", "content": {"Choosing Nutritious Breads and Wraps": [" Choose 100% whole grain breads and rolls. Your basic sandwich is generally made with bread, on a roll or in a wrap.  If you're going to choose one of these items or something similar, boost the nutrition of your sandwich by choosing whole grains. Whole grains are a more nutrient-dense and healthier option compared to refined grains (like white bread).  They're less processed and contain all the parts of the grain.  Whole grains are typically much higher in fiber, minerals and even protein compared to refined grains. Breads high in fiber keep you full longer and therefore helps stop snacking. Snacking can result in overeating, which can contribute to obesity. If you're going to choose an item like bread, a wrap, English muffin, bagel, flatbread or deli thin, go for 100% whole grains. Look at the food label to make sure your item is 100% whole grain.  The ingredient label should list only 100% whole wheat or 100% whole grain flour.   ", " Try out a tortilla or a wrap. If you want to minimize your bread intake or just try something a little different, consider using a tortilla or a wrap.  You can wrap up your sandwich fillings for a quick meal. Both tortillas and wraps are flat and are not as high in carbohydrates or calories compared to many types of bread or rolls.  They're also a little bit less filling since they're just less food overall.  Again, choose 100% whole grain if you can.  Many corn tortillas are automatically whole grain as well. Be wary of what size wrap you buy.  Many come in 6\", 8\" or even 12\".  The bigger they are, the more likely it'll count as two servings of grains.  Stick to a 6\" wrap to minimize calories and carbohydrates.  ", " Use portion controlled deli thins. Many bread companies are jumping on the low calorie, low carbohydrate band wagon by developing \"deli or sandwich thins.\"  These are rolls or bread that are very thin, low in calories and carbohydrates. These deli thins are a great substitute for regular bread.  Many companies make them in 100% whole grain versions, have added fiber and protein.  Sandwich thins are also usually low in calorie as well.  Some may only have about 100 calories for both pieces.  This may be lower than other breads or rolls you've used in the past. Again, read the ingredient list to make sure that these products are truly 100% whole grain.  ", " Consider using lettuce instead of bread. Another way to add more nutrients (and fewer calories) to your sandwich is by using a lettuce wrap.  This is a fun twist on a classic sandwich that can also make it healthier. Lettuce, like other vegetables, is naturally low in calories. Many lettuces, especially dark greens, are also high in nutrients like fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.  You use a lettuce wrap just like you would a tortilla.  You can place your sandwich fillings and toppings in a large lettuce leaf and roll up. Not all lettuces are great for wraps, but collard greens, Swiss chard, mustard greens, kale, butter lettuce, or iceberg lettuce all have large leaves that can be rolled.  ", " Try making \"naked\" or open-faced sandwich. If you're overly concerned about calories or carbs, there is one additional method for serving your sandwich.  You can try a naked or open-faced sandwich instead of the traditional sandwich. A naked sandwich is one that doesn't have any bread or wrap.  It's just the filling. For example, you could do turkey and cheese roll ups stuffed with sliced raw vegetables. An open-faced sandwich is one where you only use a single slice of bread.  It cuts down on the calories and carbohydrates that you're consuming.  These are especially great for hot sandwiches. For example, you could make an open-faced tuna melt using only one slice of whole wheat bread.  "], "Picking Out Healthy Sandwich Fillings": [" Be mindful about your condiments. Most of the time you make a sandwich, you're most likely going to add some type of sauce, dressing or condiment.  It adds a little moisture and extra flavor. Be mindful of what types and how much of these condiments you add.  You could start with a fairly nutritious or low-calorie sandwich and send it overboard with high-calorie or high-fat condiments.  Try to choose condiments that are a little lower in calorie.  Try mustard, salsa, hot sauce, horseradish, relish, hummus, reduced fat mayonnaise with olive oil, or a drizzle of olive oil and vinegar. Make sure to measure out the appropriate portion size as well.  Many are only 1 teaspoon or tablespoon per serving.  ", " Choose low-sodium proteins. Many sandwich fillings contain some sort of protein.  Whether it's peanut butter and jelly or a ham and cheese, protein usually plays an important role; however, many protein options for sandwiches are overly high in sodium.  Sandwich fillings that are frequently high in sodium include nut butters, deli meat, bacon, sausage, salami, and frozen veggie patties. A diet high in sodium can increase your risk for high blood pressure and stroke.  Sticking to lower sodium items is better for your health.  Instead of traditional deli meat items, try the following lower sodium items:  roasted turkey or chicken breast, low-sodium deli meat (look for this on the label) or sliced grilled steak. Add about 3 \u2013\u00a04 oz of lean protein to your sandwich.  This is about one serving and will help keep you satisfied.  ", " Include a source of calcium-rich dairy. A nice slice of cheese really completes a sandwich.  Don't skip it in favor of lower calories.  Cheese can also add extra nutrients to your sandwich. Cheese is part of the dairy food group.  It contains a decent amount of calcium, Vitamin D and even has some protein.  Whether or not you choose fat-free, reduced fat or full fat cheese is up to you.  The calorie difference between these options is minimal.  Fat-free cheese is more processed than the full fat, so you may enjoy the flavor of the full-fat. Make sure to measure the appropriate serving of cheese.  Only add one slice or about 1-2 ounces per sandwich.  ", " Add in some vegetables. An easy way to make any sandwich or wrap a bit healthier is by adding vegetables.  They can add a whole host of beneficial nutrients to your meal.  Vegetables are great to add to sandwiches.  They can add flavor and crunch without  many added calories. In addition, vegetables are high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.  Adding just a few to your sandwich can really boost the overall nutritional content. You can add any type of veggie to your sandwich.  It can be as simple as lettuce and tomato or you could a little more fancy with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers. One serving of vegetables is about 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.

Lightly drizzle about 1 teaspoon of your favorite hot sauce on top of each salmon cup.  You can add more if you like things more spicy. Also top each of your salmon cups with about 1/4 cup of pico de gallo, 1 teaspoon fresh cilantro chopped and salt and pepper to taste.  ", " Get classic with a tuna melt. A warm, cheesy tuna melt is a great sandwich.  Keep it portion controlled by using whole wheat English muffins instead of traditional sandwich bread.

Peel back the corner of the package and let the water the tofu comes packed in run out. Place the tofu on a plate and drape a paper towel or piece of cheesecloth over the top. Rest a heavy object, like a cookbook or metal saucepan, on top of the tofu block. This will help force out the excess moisture contained in the tofu.  Leave the tofu under constant compression for 20 to 30 minutes. Not squeezing the water out of the tofu first could result in watery sloppy joes.   ", " Dice the tofu into small cubes. Use a sharp knife to cut the block of tofu, slicing it first into long, narrow strips, then turning the strips and cutting them into pieces of the desired size. For smoother sloppy joes, dice or mince the tofu into pea-sized squares. If you prefer heartier sandwiches, you can leave the cubes slightly bigger.  You can also mash the tofu or crumble the tofu by breaking it apart with a fork.  Cutting the tofu into smaller pieces increases its surface area, which will help it cook faster.  ", " Chop up the onions, garlic and other vegetables. The onions and any other vegetables you choose to include (green pepper, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, etc.) should be roughly the same size as the tofu. Mince the garlic extra fine to avoid biting into any oversized pieces.  In addition to regular white onion, you could use a head of scallions or shallots.

Be careful not to cook the onions and garlic until they burn. This could ruin the flavor of the sloppy joes.  ", " Fry the tofu until it\u2019s crispy. Add the tofu and scramble it together with the aromatics. Let the tofu cook for about 3-5 minutes before stirring again. As it fries, it will absorb the oil and take on a crisp, golden brown finish. Dust the tofu with a coating of rice flour or cornstarch before pan frying to give it an extra crunchy texture.  Tofu doesn\u2019t change colors dramatically when cooked, so look for the edges to just begin turning golden brown and be careful not to get it too done.   ", " Season the tofu to taste. Sprinkle the tofu generously with salt, chili powder, onion powder and paprika. If you want, you can also add a pinch of black or white pepper. Sample a piece of the tofu to make sure it\u2019s seasoned just right. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll be increasing the saltiness later on when you add the canned tomatoes and other condiments.

If you enjoy a bit of spice in your snacks, a simple snack of kimchi and brown rice is perfect for a midday energy boost.  A more elaborate snack might include brown rice with sweet potatoes, nuts, and raisins for an more energizing midday snack.  White rice contains more sugar, and could cause your energy levels to crash after providing an initial boost.  Stick to brown rice.  ", " Try oatmeal.

The natural sugars in dried fruits \u2013 raisins, banana chips, and dried strawberries, for instance \u2013 provide a great source of energy.  And nuts increase protein levels.  Don\u2019t eat more than a handful, though, as carb levels that rise too quickly can cause sleepiness, which would defeat the purpose of eating trail mix as an energizing midday snack.  Throw some roasted pumpkin seeds into your trail mix for an extra dose of energizing calcium, iron, and protein.  Flax seeds are also a great addition to trail mix.  ", " Eat yogurt and granola. Granola has lots of protein to keep your energy high through the middle of the day.  Paired with plain, low-fat yogurt, your midday snack will be irresistibly delicious, as well as energizing.  Check the label on your granola to ensure it does not have added sugar.  You could choose to sprinkle your yogurt with diced apples or blueberries if you wish to sweeten it a bit.  "], "Drinking Your Snack": [" Drink coconut water. Coconut water contains energizing electrolytes.  And like regular water, it has hydrating properties that will keep you feeling fresh.  The best way to obtain coconut water is by simply buying it prepackaged, but if you\u2019re more adventurous you could get your own coconut and crack it open inside a pan or large bowl to collect the water within.  Avoid coconut water containing added sugar.  ", " Try an herbal tea. Herbal teas are those not prepared with tea leaves, but instead with infusions of spices, fruits, and herbs.

Although a simple and satisfying snack, there are a few basic steps to follow to ensure that you end up with a well cooked, carefully constructed, hearty sandwich.", "content": {"Cooking with a Skillet": [" Choose your bread based on your ingredients. One of the most integral parts of a grilled sandwich is the type of bread that you decide to use. All kinds of bread are perfectly fine for use, but some make more sense than others depending on what you will be putting inside the sandwich.  If you\u2019re planning on having very few ingredients then a basic thin bread will probably work best. If you\u2019re going to be putting more ingredients in, then it may be worth exploring some heartier types of bread. Robust bread helps hold the ingredients together and also adds to the flavor of the sandwich.   ", " Butter your bread on both sides. Ensure that the butter has been softened or is at least at room temperature. Trying to spread hard butter may result in you tearing the bread.  Buttering the bread instead of the pan will prevent burning and ensure the bread cooks evenly.  For some extra tang you can also use mayonnaise instead of butter. It will cook the same way and also add a little extra flavor to the sandwich.  ", " Assemble your sandwich. Put all the ingredients together on your bread. If you are using cheese, make sure it is a cheese that will melt (eg. Swiss, American, mozzarella). Feel free to grate the cheese onto the bread to speed up the melting process.  While assembling it\u2019s important not to get too overzealous with how high you stack your sandwich. Eventually, you'll have to flip the sandwich and you don\u2019t want it to fall apart.  ", " Heat the non-stick pan to a medium heat. To ensure that the sandwich starts cooking the moment it touches the pan, preheat it before putting the sandwich in. This should be to a medium heat where the sandwich will be able to cook gently but also thoroughly. You can always turn the temperature down later if need be.  ", " Place the sandwich into the skillet after 2-3 minutes of preheating. You should hear a nice sizzle when the bread hits the pan. This is a good sign and means the pan is at the right temperature for starting the bread at.  ", " Turn the temperature down to a medium-low if you can. The higher the temperature, the faster the bread will cook. Therefore, once the sandwich is in and has made a nice initial sizzle, turning the temperature down by just a little bit will ensure that the bread doesn\u2019t cook too fast for the fillings. Ideal temperatures for cooking vary depending on what is in your sandwich as some fillings cook faster than others. For example, mozzarella cooks very fast so when cooking a Caprese sandwich the temperature should be higher. This will mean the bread becomes golden at the same time that the mozzarella is melted.   ", " Flip the sandwich after 2-3 minutes so it can cook on the other side. Doing this will get you a nice golden brown color on both sides of the sandwich. If your sandwich is packed with ingredients then hold a plate on top of your sandwich, flip the pan, then slide the sandwich back onto the pan.   ", " Serve once golden brown on both sides. As soon as you have gotten the color you want on the bread and the ingredients inside have been cooked/melted, serve your sandwich. Be careful, it will be hot!

When using a panini press you can get away with using a basic thin bread with lots of ingredients as the sandwich is being pressed down and cooked from both sides. With that being said, feel free to explore and get creative with your bread choices. Some of these options might include: Ciabatta Multigrain Sourdough Rye  ", " Butter both sides of both pieces of bread. This is integral to getting the nice golden color and buttery flavor for your bread. The outside of each piece will get toasted but buttering the inside allows more butter to melt into the bread and create a richer flavor.  ", " Fill your sandwich with whatever ingredients you like. One of the advantages of using a panini press for your grilled sandwich is that it will have weight on top pushing downwards. This means you will have less trouble cooking with a full sandwich than with some other methods.  If you do overload your sandwich, it\u2019s possible that some ingredients get squeezed out the side. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with this it\u2019s just something to be aware of.   ", " Cook for 3-5 minutes or until the bread is golden and the ingredients are well cooked. These times will vary depending on the thickness of the bread, the ingredients in your sandwich, and the panini press you are using, but this should be about right.  The press should be on a medium heat if possible. You don\u2019t need to fully close the lid on your panini press but you are welcome to do so if you would like a more compact sandwich. Pushing the panini press down when you have more ingredients will also mean the ingredients receive more of the heat from the top and bottom.  ", " Take out and serve immediately.
