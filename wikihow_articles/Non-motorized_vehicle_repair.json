"]}}, "How to Unwobble a Bicycle Rim": {"description": "The best way to make sure a bicycle rim stops wobbling is through using a method called \"truing\" the wheel. The spokes on your bike all work together to keep the rim straight, each one pulling in a slightly different direction at the same force in order to keep the wheel straight. Because there are so many spokes to account for, this makes truing a tricky art form. But, if you're patient and go slowly, it is still very doable for any burgeoning bike mechanic.", "content": {"Fixing a Lateral (Side to Side) Wobble": [" Flip bike upside down, or put the wobbly wheel in a truing stand if you have one. You need to be able to spin the wheel freely, allowing you to see where it wobbles and make subtle changes. Usually, turning the bike upside down is more than enough, but precise mechanics can use a truing stand, which holds the wheel in place and has small calipers that let you notice even the smallest wobble. If you've got a serious wobble or issue, it can help to take the tire off first. At the very least, If not, one will likely pop while you work.    ", " Locate the bend in the rim by noting where the wheel comes nearer to the brakes. Spin the wheel, watching near the brakes to see where the wheel swings to either side. Either stop the bike at this point with your fingers, noting where it is, or use a permanent marker to measure the wobble. Simply hold the marker evenly at one height, and spin the wheel so that any wobbling are hits the marker and makes a streak.  Looking to protect your beautiful wheels from marks? Take a small piece of masking tape and use it to make the spots where there is some wobble.  ", " Understand how spokes are tightened and turned. The way you tighten spokes seems a little counter-intuitive at first, since you'll be turning spokes on both the top and bottom of the wheel. It seems like it's breaking the \"righty-tighty\" rule you've grown up with, but there is an easier way to think about it. Imagine you're looking straight down at the top of the spoke where it meets the rim. If you were to take a screwdriver and stick it into the top of the spoke, you would turn the spoke clockwise, like normal, to tighten it, and counter-clockwise to loosen it. If you're ever in doubt, imagine which direction you would turn this screwdriver, and turn accordingly. ", " Grip the spokes around your problem area and squeeze lightly, checking for looseness. If you're not sure what \"loose\" is, feel your other wheel or the spokes on other sides of the wheel. While not all wobbly wheels have noticeably loose spokes, most do, which will point out the exact spoke where there is an issue. If a spoke is extremely loose, tighten it until it is about the same tension as those around it.  If a spoke is extremely loose, you should still go ahead and try to fix it. That said, you may need a new rim if this happens regularly-- it should be a rare occurrence.  There are rare cases where a spoke feels too tense, which can cause a wobble as well. The technique to fix it (shown below) is the exact same, just with loosening instead of tightening.  ", " Note which side each spoke pulls towards to find the ones causing your wobble. The spokes will alternate which side of the rim they go to -- half to the left, half to the right. The balance between these two sides is what keeps your wheel true and prevents wobble. So, if your wheel wobbles to the left, that means the spokes on the right side are too loose to keep things balanced, or the spokes on the left are too tight. This is why you only get wobbles in certain areas -- one spoke that is too loose only affects the wheel in the precise spot. Trace the spoke down from the rim down to the center of the wheel to see which side it pulls towards.   ", " Tighten the spoke just below your problem area with a half-turn of the nipple. The golden rule of rim truing is go slow. Using your spoke wrench, a small tool with notches made to fit perfectly around the \"nipple,\" the small sheath where the spoke meets the rim. Tighten it with a half-turn clockwise, then check again. Remember -- go slowly! This first turn won't fix the issue immediately, but don't keep turning just yet.  Don't have a spoke wrench? A pair of needle-nose pliers will work in a pinch, but you should buy a spoke wrench cheaply as soon as you can. Remember to get the right side! If the wobble is to the left, you need to tighten the spoke that pulls the rim back to the right.   ", " Loosen the two spokes next to the one you just tightened, using only quarter-turns. This is how you keep the radial tension (up and down the rim, keeping it perfectly round) even without too much work. Say you just tightened a spoke on the right side of the rim, because it wobbled to the left. On either side of this spoke are two more spokes for the left side of the rim. Instead of continuing to crank on the right side, which can put too much pressure on one spoke, just loosen the spokes that pull it to the left. By using just a quarter turn on each spoke, you undo the same amount of tension on the left that you just added to the right, further balancing your wheel. Keep this simple math equation in your head as you work -- \"if I tighten one spoke, I need to loosen the two spokes next to it half as much to make sure it stays balanced.\" The opposite equation, loosening one spoke and then tightening the other two half as much, also applies.  ", " Spin the wheel and check the truing. After every set of adjustments, spin the wheel and check your work. You should be keeping an eye on the wheel frequently -- don't just blindly tighten the spokes without seeing if you're making any progress.  ", " Continue this 3-spoke adjustment process until the wobble is gone. You may need to take another set of three spokes and do the same thing. Just remember to keep the forces even, balancing out every adjustment on both sides. Never turn more than a half-turn at a time, and only work on one set of spokes at a time, allowing your to quickly undo something if you make a mistake. You will likely get smaller and smaller adjustments as you work -- using only turning the nipple by small increments. At this point, you should be spinning the wheel after every tightening, making only the smallest adjustments until you hit perfection.   ", " Check for \"flat spot\" wobbles, or a bike that is not \"radially\" true. The most common issue is when the rim wobbles left to right, but bike tires can also wobble up and down as well, forming egg-shaped wheels or small flat spots where the tension isn't quite right up and down. After fixing the rim from side to side, make sure you didn't accidentally pull the wheel out of radial true as well. Usually, you'll have a few simple adjustments to make, but they should be easy.  "], "Fixing Radial (Up and Down) Wobbling": [" Check that the bike is laterally trued first, as best as you can get it. You'll always want to finish laterally truing the bike before attacking a radial wobble. Radial wobbling is when the bicycle rim loses its perfectly round shape, and you can usually feel a little bump when riding. This has more to do with the overall tension on the bike and is easier to fix once you've got side-to-side areas ironed out. ", " Spin the rim and watch it from the side, noting any high spots using calipers or your fingers. Spin the bike and place your finger, a marker, or a set of calipers underneath the wheel, just below where it would touch the tire. Then spin the wheel and note where it rubs against the caliper. This is where the rim has elongated, and you'll need to pull it in to get this bump out of the rim.  ", " Tighten the two spokes that are on either side of the rubbing area with a half turn. One of these spokes will go to the right side of the bike, the other to the left, so tightening them both equally will pull the high spot in without ruing your radial truing. ", " Move the calipers, pen, or your finger closer in, spin the wheel, and adjust as needed. Keep working these two spokes until you've pulled the rub out of the rim, using smaller and smaller are turns (like a quarter-turn) to get more precise truing. After every set of turns, spin the wheel and double-check the lateral truing again, making sure you've not introduced a new wobble.   ", " Check that parts of the wheel don't dive inwards now, making flat spots, and loosen as necessary. This often happens on the opposite side of the wheel as the part you're working on, but it is an easy fix. Just find the two spokes on either side of your low spot and loosen them with quarter turns until you're even again.  "], "Troubleshooting": [" Know when a rim is damaged and not simply out of true. If your wheel can't stay in true, shows noticeable bending or denting, or your spokes won't stay tight, you'll need a new wheel. Oftentimes you'll need to true a wheel after a crash, which can loosen spokes, but it is not always possible. If you find yourself working and working without results, the rim is likely shot.  ", " Tighten any extra-loose spokes until they feel as tense as the rest, then make the finer adjustments. The half turn, two quarter turn system won't work if the spoke is noticeably looser than the rest. Simply tighten this spoke on its own until it feels about as tight as the spokes around it, then move on to the more precise adjustments. ", " Make sure the wheel is seated perfectly and the brakes are even if you can't seem to true the bike. Is the rim really out of true, or do you not have the wheel in the frame properly? The best way to ensure this is to release the wheel as if you were about to take it off the bike. Then squeeze the brakes to hold the bike in the center of the frame. Re-tighten the wheel into the frame and then let go of the brakes, leaving the wheel in the dead center. ", " Replace any broken spokes as soon as you can, as one broken spoke often leads to more. When you lose a spoke, you can keep riding for a bit if you have not other option to get home.

The right pedal will be on the same side as the chainring and is sometimes marked with an \u201cR.\u201d  "], "Removing Pedals with a 15mm Wrench": [" Set the bike to a high gear to shift the chain to the biggest ring. Once you set the bike to a high gear, rotate the pedals a few times so that the chain shifts to the largest ring. This will give you more room and will make it easier to remove the pedals.  If your bike doesn't have different gears, skip this step.  ", " Lift up the back wheel on the bike. Hang your bike from a bike rack or you can hang the saddle on the edge of a table or workbench while you remove the pedals. Lifting up the back wheel as you work will keep the bike still even if you pedal the bike forward or rotate the crank. This will make removing the pedals with a wrench much easier.  ", " Position a 15mm wrench between the right pedal and crank arm. The right pedal will be on the same side as your chainring. The pedal is attached to the bike's crank with a 2\u20133\u00a0in (5.1\u20137.6\u00a0cm) crank arm. Fit the 15mm wrench around the fitting where the pedal and crank arm are connected.  Rotate the pedals in a slightly forward position to make rotating the wrench easier.  ", " Pull up on the wrench to loosen the pedal. Once the crank arm is in place, pull up on the handle to loosen the bolt connecting the pedal to the crank arm. The pedal will start unthreading from the crank arm when you rotate the wrench counterclockwise. You should feel the pedal come loose after a single rotation with the wrench.  ", " Hold the pedal and rotate the crank forward to remove it. Push on the pedals so that you rotate the crank as if you were riding the bike. Hold the pedal and wrench in place and continue pedaling the bike forward until the pedal comes completely off.  ", " Turn the wrench clockwise on the left pedal to remove it. Go over to the other side of the bike and repeat the process to remove the non-drive (left) pedal of the bike. Pull up on the wrench to loosen the bolt. Then, hold the pedal in place so that it doesn't rotate as you pedal the bike forward to completely unscrew the left pedal.

This style of brake has 2 pads that press on either side of the wheel\u2019s rotor (a flat, perforated metal disc) to slow down the bike. Disc brakes come in 2 common varieties: hydraulic and mechanical. If your brakes aren\u2019t working as well as you\u2019d like them to or if they\u2019re rubbing on the rotor when you ride the bike, you can adjust them yourself with an Allen wrench.", "content": {"Assessing Your Brakes": [" Flip your bike upside down or set it in a bike stand. When you adjust your bicycle\u2019s disc brakes, the wheel should be elevated off of the ground so it can spin freely. If you have a bike stand, put your bike in the stand so it\u2019s held in place and elevated off the ground. If you do not have a bike stand, just flip your bike upside down so that the seat and handlebars are on the ground and the wheels are sticking up.  Portable bike stands are sold at most sporting goods stores. They typically cost between $35\u201350 USD.   ", " Figure out which style of disc brakes you have. Look closely at the caliper at the center of each of your bicycle\u2019s wheels. If the bike\u2019s calipers have a small cable running to them, they are mechanical. If the calipers don\u2019t have any attached cables, they\u2019re hydraulic. If you\u2019re still not sure which style you have, snap a photo of your bike\u2019s brakes and take it to a local cycling shop.  The caliper looks like a small box about 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) long that sandwiches the rotor. The caliper is the mechanical device that puts pressure on the rotor and slows down your bicycle.  ", " Tighten your wheel in the drop house before adjusting the brakes. A bike\u2019s drop house is the y-shaped frame that the wheel sits between. The drop house attaches to both sides of the wheel and keeps it connected to the bike. Make sure that the wheel is firmly in place by turning the lever on the side of the wheel clockwise. Once you\u2019ve tightened the wheel, fold the lever in until it\u2019s flush with the wheel.  On some older styles of bike, you may need to tighten the wheel in the drop house manually with an Allen wrench.  ", " Avoid touching the edge of the rotor so you don\u2019t cut yourself. The rotor (the circular metal disc that disc brakes apply force to) can be very sharp. As you\u2019re adjusting your disc brakes, try not to touch the edge of the disc. Hold the disc by placing your thumb and fingers on the disc\u2019s 2 flat sides.  If you do get a cut, stop and wash it with soap. Bandage the small wound before you finish adjusting the brakes.  "], "Adjusting Hydraulic Brakes": [" Loosen the 2 bolts on the side of your caliper if the brakes rub. If you can hear your disc brakes rubbing as you drive your bike around, it\u2019s a sign that the brakes are too tight. Inspect the caliper and find both of the inch (0.32\u00a0cm) hex bolts that hold the caliper to the frame. Insert an Allen wrench of the corresponding size and twist it a half turn counterclockwise. This should loosen the brakes enough that they stop rubbing.  It\u2019s possible that the disc brakes are too tight on only 1 wheel. In this case, you will not need to tighten the brake on your other wheel.  ", " Squeeze the brake lever 2\u20133 times to center the caliper on the rotor. After you\u2019ve loosened the 2 hex bolts, squeeze the brake lever that corresponds with the wheel you\u2019re adjusting. If you bumped the caliper while you were loosening it, this will re-center it on the rotor disc. On the last squeeze, keep pressure on the brake lever.  The right-hand brake lever controls the rear brake and the left-hand brake lever controls the front brake.  ", " Tighten the bolts by a half turn before releasing the lever. With the corresponding brake lever held down, again insert the Allen wrench into 1 of the 2 hex bolts. This time, turn the wrench a half turn clockwise to tighten the caliper around the rotor. Tighten the second hex bolts as well.  If you need to work on both the front and rear brakes at the same time, have a friend hold the brake levers while you work on the calipers.  ", " Spin the wheel to make sure that the rubbing has stopped. Make sure that the wheel is unimpeded and can turn freely. Give the wheel a firm spin (in either direction). Listen for the sound of rubbing.  If the disc brakes no longer rub, you\u2019ve adjusted them successfully!  ", " Align the caliper visually over the rotor if the brakes still rub. If the brakes continue to rub, loosen the bolts by a quarter turn. Look down from the top of the caliper and visually align it so that it sits directly over the rotor. With the brake lever held down, fine tune the position of the caliper so that it\u2019s fully centered. Then, tighten the hex bolts a quarter turn.  Again test the brakes by spinning the wheel and listening for the sound of rubbing brakes.  "], "Tweaking Mechanical Brakes": [" Loosen the small set screw found on the side of the caliper. Some models of mechanical disc brakes have a small \u201cset\u201d screw that clamps down on the caliper\u2019s adjustment dial to prevent it from loosening while you\u2019re riding the bike around. Use a small Philips head screwdriver to turn the set screw 1\u20132 full rotations counterclockwise.  Not all bikes with mechanical disc brakes have a set screw on the caliper. If yours doesn\u2019t, you can skip this step.  ", " Twist the adjustment dial on the side of the caliper to adjust the brakes. Most bikes with mechanical disc brakes have a 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) wide plastic dial on the side of the caliper (right next to the wheel\u2019s spokes). Turn the wheel clockwise to move the brake pad closer to the rotor and counterclockwise to move it farther away from the rotor.  In some cases, bikes with mechanical disc brakes may not have an adjustment dial on the side of the caliper. In this case, there will be a hex bolt on the caliper that fills the same function.  ", " Adjust the dial until the caliper is centered directly over the metal rotor. It typically takes some fiddling to line the caliper so it\u2019s centered over the rotor. Periodically give the bike\u2019s wheel a spin and visually inspect the brake pad so that you can tell if the pad is rubbing on the disc brake.  Most rotors aren\u2019t perfectly flat, so don\u2019t worry if you see a small amount of wobble as the rotor spins.  ", " Squeeze the brake lever to make sure that the brakes tighten. Give the lever that corresponds to the brake that you\u2019re adjusting a firm squeeze. The 2 pads should tighten on either side of the rotor. Both of the pads should touch the rotor disc at the same time; if 1 touches before the other, the rotor isn\u2019t properly centered beneath the caliper.  The right-hand brake lever works the rear brake, and the left-hand brake lever works the front brake.  ", " Tighten the hex bolts and the set screw before riding your bike. Use your Allen wrench to turn the 2 hex nuts on the side of the caliper clockwise. Even if you didn\u2019t loosen them when you were adjusting your mechanical disc brakes, check to make sure that the hex bolts are tight. Also use your screwdriver to tighten the small set screw that you loosened earlier.  Once you\u2019ve tightened the bolts, the bike should be ready to ride!
