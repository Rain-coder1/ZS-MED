Look for a space you can safely get your vehicle into without hitting another vehicle.  Once you get better at parallel parking, you may be able to park in tighter spaces, but you may want to start with spaces that have six feet (two meters) of extra space. The space needs to be at least three feet (a meter) longer than your vehicle.  If you've never parallel parked before, consider bringing plastic bins or cones to a parking lot and practice parallel parking between them.   ", " Ensure it is a safe, legal parking space. Look for signs that indicate parking regulations in the area. Make sure you\u2019re not parking in front of a fire hydrant or another area you cannot block.  Note any time limits for the spot. Make sure nothing is sticking off the end of the either of the vehicles you hope to park between, such as a trailer hitch. If so, ensure you have enough room to fit into the space. Note the height of the curb next to the space. If it is especially high, you\u2019ll want to take care not to back into it.  ", " Turn on your signal and position yourself to back in. Check your rear view mirror to confirm that no one is immediately behind you. Brake gently to indicate that you are slowing down. Use your turn signal and pull up next to the vehicle in front of the space. About two feet (60 cm) between your vehicle and the parked vehicle is ideal.  If another vehicle comes up behind you while you are trying to park, stay where you are and keep signaling.  Roll down your window and hand-signal the other driver to go around you if necessary. The tighter the space, the closer you'll need to get to the other vehicle when you pull up beside it. For instance, you may need to position your vehicle about a foot (30cm) beside the vehicle in front of your space if the space only has an extra meter or so to work with.

Even if you are more confident in your parking skills, you should always double check your blind spots to ensure you don\u2019t back into kids, pedestrians, or moving objects, like strollers and shopping carts. Larger vehicles may have additional mirror mounted to the body of the vehicle to improve visibility. These additional mirrors can be easily forgotten by casual large vehicle drivers. Check these regularly when parking.    ", " Give yourself plenty of space. The more space you have to pull into your spot, the more space you\u2019ll have to maneuver and make adjustments while parking. You might give yourself more space by parking in an empty part of a parking lot, or you could also choose a spot that is surrounded by smaller, more compact vehicles. Smaller vehicles on either side of your large truck will take up less space in their own parking spot, giving you more leeway as you park.   ", " Park slowly and brake early.

Taking your time when parking your large vehicle can prevent costly errors, like damaging cars around you or hitting a parking barrier.  ", " Pull in to wide open spots. This is perhaps the safest route if you are less confidant in your large vehicle parking ability. Choose a location of the parking area that is free of other cars. Cut your wheel in the direction you are turning to move into the spot. You may notice your front end swinging over the parking spot lines into the spot beside you. This is due to the fact that larger vehicles require a wider turning radius to complete turns.  You may need to adjust your vehicle in your space after pulling in. Put your vehicle in reverse, check your mirrors and blind spots, then back up. When you pull back into your spot after backing out, adjust your wheel to straighten out your vehicle as you pull into the spot again.  ", " Avoid overshooting or undercutting your turn. The length of your large vehicle will require more space spent turning for you to straighten it out and pull it evenly into its spot. Turning as you would normally in a regular car can lead to over or underturning, potentially into other vehicles. To prevent this you should:  Maneuver your vehicle as far away from the parking spot as you are able. The more space you have to approach, the easier it will be for you to straighten your back end and pull into the spot. Cut your wheel hard in the direction of the spot you are parking. You\u2019ll want the front end of your truck to enter the spot as straight as possible. Check your mirrors constantly while pulling into your spot. The side of your vehicle may still be straightening, and you\u2019ll need to keep a careful eye to ensure you do not bump or scratch other vehicles.   ", " Straighten your vehicle with a three-point turn. The more aligned your back end is with the spot you are aiming to park in, the less turning you will have to do and the easier your parking job will be. A three-point turn is where you turn in one direction as far as you are able, put your vehicle in reverse to straighten your front end, and then finish your turn by continuing it. You can use this while parking by: Pulling your front end close to one of the vehicles next to the spot in which you are parking. Putting your vehicle in reverse and straightening it to line up with your spot as much as possible. Be sure to check your mirrors and blind spots so you don\u2019t hit any pedestrians or cars parked behind you.  ", " Pull into your spot evenly out of your three-point turn. Now that your car is more lined up with the spot, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll only have to make slight adjustments to your course as you pull into it. Executing this move in tight spaces is a valuable skill when driving a large vehicle, so you may want to practice how to make a three-point turn . "], "Backing Large Vehicles into a Parking Spot": [" Identify your backing up maneuver. There are four main kinds of backing up maneuvers you might come across in your large vehicle driving: straight back, offset back, alley dock, and parallel parking. Each of these can be identified by the following characteristics:  spots are usually located in a grid and form a perpendicular (L-shaped) angle with the traffic passage that vehicles pass through to go deeper into or exit from the parking area.  spaces are usually arranged in an offset grid. These meet the traffic passage vehicles use to enter into or exit the parking area at a diagonal angle.  spaces are almost always for semi-trucks. These require you to move straight back through a narrow passage and then turn sharply to maneuver the trailer to meet a loading/unloading dock, which is usually at a right angle (L-shape) to the passage.  spaces are on the side of the road, with either traffic, obstacles, or empty spaces before or after the spot. These require you to back your vehicle in, and can be especially challenging. New drivers may want to avoid these if at all possible.   ", " Understand the mechanics of backing up. This is going to be slightly different for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer versus large, normal trucks that have a bed attached to the cab. While large, attached-bed trucks will turn similarly to smaller vehicles you may be used to driving, these will require plenty of extra room to complete the turn. Semi-trucks/vehicles with trailers will turn backwards the direction you turn your wheel.  Getting the hang of backing up a semi-truck/vehicle with a trailer requires time and practice. You should consider finding an empty parking area and executing reverse maneuvers to get a feel for how your trailer responds to turning. If you are are prepping for a driving test or expect to have to reverse your large vehicle into a space, you should purchase some traffic cones from your local hardware store or set out some obstacles, like a cheap folding chair, in an empty parking area. This way you can practice avoiding and guiding your trailer/rear end around obstacles.  ", " Pull ahead of your spot. You'll want to pull several feet ahead of your parking spot to make sure your turn doesn't cut too sharp and hit parked vehicles in the near-side spot, or swing wide and hit vehicles parked in the far-side spot. The more distance between your large vehicle and the parked cars means you will have more distance to straighten your rear-end before approaching the parked vehicles. This extra room can be the difference between scraping up another car and sliding into your spot without incident. Roll down your mirrors on both the driver and passenger side of your vehicle. You want as clear and as unobstructed a view as possible of your mirrors. Do this especially it it's raining, as raindrops can negatively impact your perspective or obstruct your view. Ask any passengers to step out of the vehicle. Even well-behaved passengers can be difficult to see around while backing up. A clear line of sight will help you prevent potential damage to your vehicle or others.  ", " Check your mirrors and do a walk-around. Your mirrors should give you a general sense of the dimensions of the area you will be parking in. However, mirrors can sometimes distort distance or miss important features, like thin metal signs, posts, and so on. Take note of the surroundings in your mirrors and step outside of your vehicle. Then: Compare your walk-around evaluation of the parking area to your mirror view. Note any inconsistencies, difficult to see obstacles, or missed obstacles. Evaluate the size of the parking spot. If you feel that the spot might not be a good fit, or if you are nervous in your ability to park, you are probably better off finding another parking spot. Adjust your mirrors upon returning to your vehicle. Now that you have a more complete idea of the area in which you are parking, you can adjust your mirrors to give you a better perspective of the surrounding area you will be turning into. Your mirrors will normally be situated for straight-traffic driving, so adjusting these for a better parking view can help immensely.   ", " Swing out wide with your cab. For attached-bed trucks as well, but especially for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer, you should swing your front-end in an outward arc away from your parking spot by cutting your wheel of the parking spot. This will allow the rear-end of your vehicle to cut sharply in the direction of the space you are attempting to park in. Once your rear-end is angled diagonally into the spot, straighten it by turning your wheel \u00bc turn or less in the direction from the spot. The more space between you and the already parked vehicles/obstacles surrounding the spot in which you are attempting to park, the more time you'll have to align your rear end with the parking spot. This will give you more space to make small adjustments and guide your rear-end into the spot. Outside of your initial hard cut in the direction of the parking spot, which began the hard turn of your rear-end toward the spot, you should only make slight adjustments while backing up. Large adjustments will likely result in over- or under-steering. If you feel your angle of approach too far off, you should pull out and start again. You should keep a close eye on the front- and rear-end of your vehicle during these maneuvers. While swinging out wide with your cab to angle your rear-end into the spot, it's easy to swing out into cars parked in spots across from the one you are backing into.   ", " Straighten out your cab. Once your rear end is aligned with the spot, your cab will likely still be at an angle to it. Allow your rear end to travel a few more feet into the spot, then turn your wheel in the direction you made your first hard cut - in the direction of the spot. This should begin straightening your cab without changing the angle of your rear-end. Use gentle steering corrections at this point; oversteering could result in the angle of your trailer/rear-end changing significantly. Some spots are too narrow or are at too sharp of an angle for you to back into in one attempt. Even experienced large vehicle drivers sometimes need several tries before their vehicle is in the right position when backing into a spot. Adjust your vehicle as necessary. You may need to pull out of your spot, straighten your vehicle one more time, and reverse back into it, nice and even. When pulling out, be careful your rear-end does not cut short or wide into surrounding vehicles.   "], "Parking Large Vehicles Safely": [" Make use of designated large vehicle parking.

You might want to plan your route well in advance so that you know where you can park easily while on your trip. A few popular sites that give comprehensive resources on roadway information are:   ", " Know the legal expectations for large vehicles. Due to the fact that your large vehicle can block the view of smaller ones and sometimes create a dangerous blind spot on the road, there are laws in place to prevent this from happening. These laws will vary between state and country, but generally you should : Park on a road with a speed limit over 30 mph (48 kph) unless your vehicle is disabled. Park in a way that blocks the view of the road from driveways and other streets. Park with your vehicle facing opposite the direction of traffic.   ", " Signal emergency stops soon after occurring. When you are forced to stop on the side of a road due to mechanical issues or some other problem, you must place emergency warning devices no later than ten minutes after coming to a stop. Different kinds of roads will require different placement of your warning devices, such as: On or near a one-direction street or a divided highway, you will need to place your warning devices at 10, 100, and 200 feet (3, 30.5, and 61 m) behind your vehicle. On a two-lane road with traffic that moves in either direction, or on an undivided highway, you should place warning devices 10 feet (3 m) in front of and behind the front and rear corners of your vehicle and 100 feet (30.5 m) ahead of and behind your vehicle. On bends, curves, and hills that obstruct the view of your warning devices, you\u2019ll need to place your rearmost device so it can be clearly seen before the sight obstruction.  ", " Make a physical check of potential parking spots. Smaller parking lots and residential areas are built with smaller vehicles in mind. The best way you can gauge the space of these places is by stepping out of your vehicle and getting a clear look of your surroundings.  If possible, you should make use of a spotter, who can direct you as you move into the spot safely.   ", " Use your parking break always. Larger vehicles are much heavier than your average sedan.

One of the most important pieces of etiquette when dropping your car off, aside from tipping, of course, is keeping your keys in the ignition and your car running once you\u2019ve parked. Valet workers move very quickly, and having to restart your car will slow them down.  ", " Let the valet worker open your door for you. Although this is not mandatory, as you can absolutely open the door yourself, it is a part of the valet parking culture for the valet worker to help you out of the car. This will also let the valet worker move at their own pace. Getting out of the car too early may throw off the pace of the worker and slow them down.  Having your door opened for you is a pleasant experience and will show that the valet worker is professional and hard-working, so consider this when you tip. This service will also depend on your environment. If you are arriving at a luxurious hotel or restaurant, it can be expected.  ", " Tell the valet worker about any problems with your car. If there is any problem with your vehicle that will impede in the process of parking the car, the valet drive will need to be informed. Do not go into too much detail, though, as the valet worker will be in a hurry. Simply and directly communicate the car\u2019s problems or quirks and let the worker keep moving.  It is a good idea, for instance, to tell your valet if you have any problems with your brakes or door latches, or if your seats have problems adjusting. You can tell them some other important details, too, like whether the vehicle is an automatic or manual.  ", " Get your ticket from the valet and put it in a safe place. Although you will still be able to pick up your car with your driver's license, this will significantly slow down the process when you come back to pick up your vehicle. Place the ticket in your wallet, purse, or any other safe, easily reachable place.  If you do not receive a ticket when dropping your car off, consider asking the drivers in case they forgot to give you one.  ", " Tip the valet driver $2 - $5 (USD) before they enter the vehicle. Tipping before the driver parks your vehicle is an important part of valet etiquette. This early tip will help your chances of having your vehicle returned in perfect condition and will let the driver know that you care about the vehicle and that you appreciate the service.  Save 2 to 5 more dollars to tip the driver once you return to your vehicle. Be sure to tip the driver who is going to be parking your car, not another employee.  "], "Picking up Your Car": [" Call ahead if you are in a hurry. Although valet companies value their ability to retrieve cars quickly, this may be difficult during busy hours. If you have somewhere to go and do not want to wait for your car to be dropped off, calling ahead and letting the valet workers know that you are coming will expedite the process and ensure that your car will be waiting for you when you return.  Give the valet drivers at least 10 to 20 minutes if you expect things to be unusually busy, or if you are leaving an event at the same time as a large group of people.  ", " Hand your ticket to one of the valet workers. There will often be a valet worker behind a desk whose job it is to take tickets and inform drivers which cars to retrieve. Have your ticket ready when you approach the desk so that things run smoothly. The valet employee may ask for your name and for your basic information.  ", " Check your vehicle for damages once it arrives. Before tipping the valet driver or receiving the keys to your vehicle, do a quick walk around your vehicle looking for damages, large and small. Check the doors for dings, the back bumper for dents, and the front of the car for any damages that weren\u2019t already there.  If there are damages to the car, inform the driver and ask to speak with a manager about the damages. Depending on where you live, the liable party for damages to your car will differ. Often, the driver is liable, but some companies will take on the liability themselves. Communicating damages right away is vital, as you will not be able to prove that the company is responsible if you drive away.  ", " Tip the driver $2 - $5 (USD) again before leaving. Once the driver hands you your keys, hand the driver this second tip to meet proper valet etiquette. Thank the driver for working so hard and let them know that you appreciate their service. If you feel as though the driver did a particularly outstanding job, feel free to tip more.  "]}}, "How to Park Safely": {"description": "The world is a dangerous place.

The length of time you\u2019ll leave your car in airport parking is also an important factor in choosing a place to park. This is because different parking lots and services are geared toward different amounts of time. Hourly parking is great if you\u2019re just dropping someone off at the airport and want to escort them to security check point. Very often, this parking is available from one to three hours. Short term parking provides parking over the course of a day or even several days. This is best if you\u2019ll park your car for less than two days.

Off-site airport parking at lots not affiliated with airports can be substantially cheaper. In Atlanta, you may find parking as cheap as $6 a day. However, make sure to consider safety and transportation to the terminal. For people who need different options, the cost of short-term parking is about a dollar per hour at many regional air ports, and $3 or $4 an hour at major airports like Los Angeles International.
