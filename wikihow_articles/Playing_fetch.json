All dogs need exercise, and a chance to bond with their owner. That said, a ball-obsessed dog is not just an annoyance. If the drive to chase the ball is too strong, the dog may push itself past its limits and suffer from heatstroke or injured joints. Training is the best long-term solution for controlling a dog's fetching behavior.", "content": {"Training Obedience During Fetch": [" Begin with basic training . Start here if your dog hasn't yet learned basic commands, such as \"Sit\" and \"Come.\" These are easy first commands to learn, because the dog can connect them to an obvious, immediate action. Train the dog in sessions no longer than 15 minutes at a time, using these techniques:  Get the dog's attention with a treat or toy. Say a short command (like \"Sit\") in a loud, clear voice. Say the command one time only, to teach the dog that he needs to respond right away. To get the dog to sit, raise the treat above the dog's ahead, or gently press down on the hindquarters. For other commands, you may need to mimic what you want the dog to do, or wait until the dog does it accidentally. Praise the dog as soon as he obeys, and give the treat. Many dog owners use a clicker tool to make a sound that the dog will learn means a reward.   ", " Teach the dog to drop it . Once the dog knows a couple commands (at least Sit and Come), you can start teaching it good manners during fetch. The Drop It command is useful for dogs that won't let go of the ball or stick, even while they're begging for you to throw it again. Here's how to train this behavior: Give the dog a toy to hold in its mouth. Choose one it likes to play fetch with. Hold a small treat near its mouth. Pick something the dog likes, but not so much that it ignores the toy. When the dog lets go to eat the food, say \"Drop it\" and pick up the toy. Repeat until the dog starts opening its mouth as your hand approaches. When this happens, start saying \"Drop it\" before the toy is released. Finally (perhaps after several 5\u201315 minute sessions), leave out the food and reward the dog with praise instead.  ", " React to begging by starting a different form of play. When the dog tries to start a fetch session, throwing the ball will teach it that this method works. This isn't a problem for many dogs, but if yours wants to play fetch for 24 hours, deflect these requests with other activities. Take the dog outside instead, go for a jog, or give him a belly rub. Once the dog is distracted, get its attention and start a fetch session. This shows that are the one who decides when to play fetch, not the dog.e yourself. ", " Be firm when ending a play session. Don't let the dog determine when you play fetch. Watching her bark, whine , and jump isn't fun, but if you give in, she'll learn that it gets her what she wants. Don't give in to \"one last throw\" after you decide to end it. A stern \"That's enough\" or \"No play\" command can teach some dogs to stop bothering you. This is more difficult to train, since you can only use the command while the dog is misbehaving. Try an additional signal, such as clapping your hands, to reinforce the idea. When playing outdoors, end the play session by putting on the leash and walking calmly back inside or to the car.  ", " Stick to a schedule if necessary. Some \"ball-obsessed\" dogs, including many retrievers, have trouble resisting the extreme drive to play fetch. If you've tried training for two or three weeks and you aren't happy with the results, start a fetch schedule. Play fetch only at certain times of day, in five minute sessions \u2014 or longer sessions with a break every five minutes. If you regularly visit a dog park or other play area, consider only playing fetch during those visits. The more structured the play session is, the more likely the dog is to learn how it works. Try starting each session by saying \"Playtime!,\" and giving the dog a set of commands: \"Sit,\" \"Stay,\" \"Fetch,\" \"Come,\" \"Drop It.\"  "], "Other Solutions": [" Hide the ball. If you don't want to play fetch, take the ball or other thrown object and hide it. Do this when the dog isn't looking, and place the ball somewhere the dog can't see it. If your dog want to play fetch constantly (and is getting adequate exercise), keep the ball hidden. Only take it out during playtime. When outside, hold the ball on the side opposite the dog, or hide it in a bag.  ", " Distract the dog. Try this of the dog won't obey a \"drop it\" command, or won't stop harassing you. Show the dog a treat and toss it next to him. Toss another treat a few feet (couple meters) away. When the dog goes for it, grab the ball and hide it. This is best used when you're looking after another person's dog and urgently need cooperation. If this is your own dog, training it is the better long term option.  ", " Get a mechanical thrower. These devices automatically launch tennis balls across your backyard or hallway. If your dog is bored or doesn't get enough exercise, this could be a good solution. Keep an eye on the dog the first few times it plays. Make sure the thrower doesn't launch the ball hard enough to hurt the dog.

Nowadays, the boomerang is used for sport and recreation, and is famous for its unique ability to return to the thrower. Throwing a returning boomerang is a skill which requires a specific technique and plenty of practice, making it a feat akin to getting a hole in one on the golf course.", "content": {"Gripping the Boomerang": [" Start with the proper grip. You can hold the boomerang on either arm -- the lift (leading) arm or the dingle (trailing) arm. Either way, make sure that the painted, curved side is always facing toward you and the flat side is facing away from you.   ", " Try the pinch grip. The pinch grip involves \"pinching\" the boomerang between your thumb and index finger. You throw the boomerang by flicking your wrist backwards before snapping it forwards. This creates enough momentum to pull the boomerang out of your hand and create spin.  ", " Test the cradle grip. This grip is similar to the pinch grip, except you wrap your index finger (or all four fingers) around the edge of the boomerang instead. Grip the boomerang as close to the bottom of the arm as possible, and as you throw, flick the boomerang with your index finger as if pulling a trigger. This helps to create spin.  "], "Finding Good Throwing Conditions": [" Find a large, open area. Choose an area where you have at least 50 meters (164.0\u00a0ft) of space on all sides. Football fields, soccer pitches, and open park spaces are all good options. Make sure there are not too many trees or bushes for your boomerang to get caught in, or large bodies of water for it to fall into.  Avoid practicing your boomerang throw in crowded areas, or places with a lot of windows or parked cars. It can be difficult to predict where your boomerang will land, and a mis-thrown boomerang can cause significant injury or damage to property.  You should always throw from the center of an open space. This will help you to throw more consistently, while also providing some leeway on all sides if the flight of the boomerang doesn't go as planned.   ", " Watch out for weather conditions. Wind is one of the most important  factors in the proper return of a boomerang. Ideally, you want a nice calm day, with winds between 0 to 10 mph (16 km/h). Some boomerangs will not return in completely calm weather, but most will. Avoid throwing your boomerang in high winds, as it will distort the path of the boomerang and throw it off course.  Light rain will not distort the flight of the boomerang. If you choose to use your boomerang on rainy days, put a protective seal on it, especially if it's made from wood, to prevent it from swelling with moisture.  Even though falling snow will not affect the flight of the boomerang, snow on the ground will conceal a fallen boomerang, making it almost impossible to find.   ", " Throw the boomerang around the wind. You want to throw the boomerang \"around\" the wind, meaning that you throw it to the right of an oncoming wind, and it returns on the left (or the opposite if you're left-handed). You want to throw your boomerang between 45 to 90 degrees to the right or left of an oncoming wind.  To figure out wind direction, pick up a fistful of grass or leave and throw them into the air. If the leaves blow across your face to the right, you will need to turn left, and vice versa.  Stand so that the wind is blowing directly into your face, then turn about 45 degrees to the left or right, depending on which is your dominant hand.  Some boomerangs work better when thrown at a wider angle to the wind (up to 90 degrees) so experiment a little to find out which angle works best for you.   "], "Throwing with Proper Technique": [" Throw the boomerang vertically, with the correct layover. Boomerangs should be thrown vertically overhand, as if throwing a baseball, so they will cartwheel end-over-end. Hold the boomerang so that it's perpendicular with the ground, tilting it 5 to 20 degrees to the right (if you're right-handed) or to the left (if you're left-handed).  The degree to which you tilt the boomerang is called the layover. If using a wide layover, you should throw the boomerang softly, whereas more vertical layovers will require harder throws.  Throwing a boomerang horizontally will prevent the boomerang from returning. It will cause the boomerang to climb high into the air, before dropping straight back to the ground and potentially breaking.   ", " Throw the boomerang at the appropriate elevation. Most boomerangs only need to be thrown at eye-level, with an elevation about 10 degrees above the ground. A good trick is to pick a point slightly above the horizon, such as some far-away tree top, and aim directly for it.  ", " Figure out the footwork. A right-handed thrower will need to pivot their right foot outwards, lift their left leg so all the weight is on the right, then step forwards onto the left foot as they throw, in a move that's known as \"casting the foot out.\" Left-handed people will do the exact opposite. This helps to put more weight behind the throw, increasing the distance the boomerang will travel.  ", " Give it some spin. Spinning the boomerang as you throw is perhaps the most important deciding factor in whether your boomerang returns to you or not. You can give your boomerang spin by cocking your wrist backwards, then snapping it forwards as you throw. You shouldn't just release the boomerang -- it should be ripped from your grip by the force of the spin.  ", " Focus on technique, not strength. Unless you're really focused on distance, the strength of your throw is not the most important thing when it comes to throwing a boomerang. Once you have the hang of putting a good spin on your throw, you can start to focus on power.  ", " Catch the boomerang. The best way to catch a returning boomerang is to extend both arms, wait until the boomerang reaches below shoulder level, then clap your hands together to catch the boomerang between your palms (known as the sandwich catch). If you've lost sight of your boomerang, or it's coming at you too fast, turn around, hunker to the ground, and cover your head with hands.  There are lots of trick catches you can try, such as the under-the-leg catch, the hand-to-foot catch and behind-the-back catch. You may want to wear some padded fingerless gloves to protect your hands while attempting these trick catches.   "], "Choosing the Right Boomerang": [" Purchase a high quality boomerang. The type of boomerang you buy will have a significant impact on whether you will get it to come back to you or not. Boomerangs are made from regular pieces of wood or plastic, so it takes some skilled workmanship to imbue such everyday materials with the aerodynamic qualities that make boomerangs so unique. There are loads of boomerangs on the market, but not all of them are true returning boomerangs, so do your research before you buy.  ", " Beginners should choose a v-shaped or a tri-bladed boomerang. Pick one that is made from lightweight materials. These boomerangs do not require a strong throw, which allows beginners to focus more on technique. They will usually travel between 10 to 25 meters (32.8 to 82.0\u00a0ft) before returning.  ", " Choose a heavier boomerang if you are advanced. Once you have mastered the throwing technique and your boomerang is consistently returning, you can move on to intermediate and, later, advanced boomerangs. These boomerangs tend to be heavier, come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can travel distances of up to 50 meters (164.0\u00a0ft) before returning.  ", " Pick a boomerang made for your dominant hand. Be aware that you will need either a left-handed or right-handed boomerang depending on your dominant hand. If you're left-handed, you will have considerable difficulty in throwing a right-handed boomerang with any success. "], "Troubleshooting": [" Reassess your throw if your boomerang won't come back. If your boomerang is failing to return to you, the reason is one of two things: your boomerang is of poor quality, or your throw is incorrect. If you think your throw is incorrect, focus on correcting the following common mistakes:  Decrease the layover of your throw. If your throw is too horizontal, it will almost certainly fail to come back. Throw your boomerang vertically for best results. Don't throw the boomerang your body. Instead, throw it straight ahead. If your throwing hand ends up across from the opposite shoulder, you know you're doing it incorrectly. Work on your spin. Focus on flicking your wrist, as this is where most of the spin comes from. You can also experiment with different grips and hand positioning to find out which is most comfortable and effective for you.  ", " Change your direction if your boomerang returns to the wrong spot. If the boomerang comes back but lands too far in front of you or too far behind you to catch, you are probably facing the wrong direction in relation to the wind.  If the boomerang lands in front of you, try turning a few degrees to the left, so you are throwing more directly into the wind. If the boomerang lands behind you, try turning a few degrees to the right, so you are throwing further away from the wind. These directions will be reversed if you are left-handed.  ", " Watch your boomerang closely if you keep losing sight of it. The flight of a boomerang is almost impossible to predict, so if you look away for even a second, you may not be able to find it again. If you've thrown it well, the boomerang may fly back suddenly and hit you in the face. But if you've thrown it badly, you may never be able to find it again.  Wear sunglasses while practicing in case your boomerang flies into the path of the sun. They will also protect your eyes should your boomerang come back and hit you in the face. If the boomerang falls out of the sky as the result of a bad throw, make a mental note of a landmark you can use to locate it. Search for it right away, as you may not be able to find it later.  ", " Repair your boomerang if it becomes warped or nicked. Boomerangs can easily become warped or dented due to repeated crash landings or fumbled catches. However, with a little love and care most of these problems can be patched up and your boomerang will still be in perfect working order.   Place the boomerang in the microwave or hold it over the heat on an electric stove for 8-10 seconds. Bend the boomerang in the opposite direction to the warp and hold it in place until the wood cools again.   Fill any holes with a little wood putty. Once the putty dries, sand the boomerang until smooth, then cover with a coat of polyurethane seal to keep moisture out.

If you want to learn to play, you can get a simple overview of the easy rules, learn to get a game going, and how to strategize to give your team the best chance of winning.", "content": {"Learning the Rules": [" Find a suitable playing field. To play ultimate Frisbee, you\u2019ll need a bit of room to spread out. Traditionally played on soccer or football fields, ultimate Frisbee can be played in any open field that\u2019s at least 70 yards by 40 yards, with marked-off end zones at each end, where points are scored. In regulation Ultimate Frisbee, the end zones are 20 yards deep.  Work with the space you have. If you\u2019re playing in a backyard, don\u2019t worry about measuring it off. Just set up two end zones at each end of the yard to give each team a territory, then start playing.   ", " Divide into two teams. Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport that will require at least a handful of players on each side to play. Split up your group of friends into two evenly-divided teams.  The absolute minimum of players would be four\u2013two per team\u2013but that would be a challenging game. It\u2019s usually best with between five and seven players, per side. Regulation Ultimate Frisbee teams have seven players on each side, though the roster can include as many players as you want. Players may be substituted any time after a point is scored.  ", " Play with the correct kind of disc. You can play Ultimate Frisbee with any kind of Frisbee, though it\u2019s typically easier and more recommended to play with a slightly heavier version of the classic recreational disc. This makes controlling your passes and your distance a lot easier than with a basic beach Frisbee.  175 gram Frisbees are recommended for playing Ultimate Frisbee, which are widely available at sporting goods stores. The Discraft Ultra-Star 175 is the official playing disc for the USA Ultimate Championship Series.  ", " Learn how play is advanced. As in soccer, American football, lacrosse, or other goal-based sports, each team has one end zone that they\u2019re defending and will attempt to score in their opponent\u2019s end zone. The object of the game is to move the Frisbee down the field by completing passes to your teammates.  The player in possession of the Frisbee may not move and must not hold the Frisbee for longer than 10 seconds. The rest of the players will move around the field and attempt to get open for a pass. If a pass is dropped, goes out of bounds, or is intercepted, play is turned over to the defending team at the point of play. Meanwhile, the team not in possession of the Frisbee will attempt to intercept the disc and otherwise disrupt the passes made by the team in possession.  ", " Find a league in your area to learn more. It can be hard to find enough people who know how to play informally, and get a regular game going. For this reason, the best way to learn the strategies, techniques, and enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee is to find a league in your area in which you'll be able to learn the ropes and have fun making new friends. You can find pick-up games in your area here . "], "Playing the Game": [" Launch the Frisbee to the winner of the coin toss. After dividing into two even teams and going over the basic rules, pick which team will start with possession. This can be done by tossing a coin, flipping the Frisbee, or using some other method of your choice, then launching the disc to start play.  The opposing team will stand at their end zone and \u201cpull\u201d the disc to the other team, essentially tossing it in the air for someone to grab, much as a ball is kicked off in American football. This will also happen after each point is scored. The puller should make sure everyone is ready, then toss the Frisbee high toward the opponent's group of players. All the pullers teammates should immediately run toward the opposition to start playing defense.  ", " Score points with complete passes. A point is scored by completing a pass into the opponent\u2019s end zone territory. Upon scoring a point, the possession of the disc changes to the team that was scored upon. The team in possession of the Frisbee will be trying to score and the other team will be trying to disrupt play and get possession of the Frisbee, so they may score.  A point is scored when a player passes the Frisbee to another player who is standing in the end zone, and that player makes the catch successfully. At that point, play ends and the defending team will receive possession of the Frisbee. Substitutions may be made in the transition period after a point is scored and before the other team takes over possession of the disc.  ", " Do not make contact with opposing players. Physically contacting players on the opposing team is illegal. Picks, screens, and other disruptive plays are not allowed in Ultimate Frisbee. It\u2019s important for defenders to be disruptive and guard the other team, much as in basketball, but without actually coming into contact.  It is up to the defender guarding the player in possession of the Frisbee to count to 10, usually aloud. It is this defenders job to police 10-second infractions.  ", " Play to 15 points. Typically, a game of Ultimate Frisbee ends when one team scores 15 points, though you can amend this rule to fit your time constraints and your desires for the game. Typically, a game to 15 can take as long as an hour and a half, so you might want to play to seven or 10, if you don\u2019t have that long.  ", " Police yourselves. Ultimate Frisbee is uniquely anarchic. Even in regulation play, no referees or line judges are used to govern play. Fouls, points, and disputes are resolved on-field by the two teams. Ultimate Frisbee requires honesty and goodwill, making it a game of trust and fun.  Sometimes an \u201cobserver\u201d is used to offer some objective party, uncommitted to each side, who may be used for procedural details, such as keeping track of the time.  "], "Using Strategy": [" Practice making good throws before you try to play Ultimate. To throw a Frisbee correctly, place your index and middle finger under disk, close to the lip. Curl the two fingers to get a firm grip, and twist your body to your throwing hand side. Take a step forward with your dominant foot, and untwist your body. Once you have faced forward, flick your wrist, release the disc, and point where you want the disc to go. Keep the Frisbee parallel to the ground.  ", " Learn more advanced throws as you improve your game. As you advance, you can develop more complex throwing motions into your game with some practice. This is To \"hammer throw,\" put your index and middle fingers under the disk and put your thumb on top. Do not curl your index and middle fingers. Like you are throwing any ball, raise the disk over your head, and have the disk angled towards your head. Make sure you have about a 50-55 degree angle on the disk. Still keeping the angle, throw the disk forward and upward. The disk should fly perpendicular to the ground for a couple seconds and flip upside down to float softly to the ground. This throw is a little tricky to catch, but can be useful under heavy defense. Try a sidearm toss. Place your index and middle fingers under the disk, and curl them against the lip of the disk. Place your thumb on top. Twist your body slightly towards the disk, and flick your wrist to release the disk. Make sure you twist your hand towards your body when you throw to put enough spin the disk to fly. This throw is very useful when you are being defended by an opposing player, but takes practice.  ", " Make quick passes. The difference between teams that are good at Ultimate Frisbee and teams that are just playing is in the speed of the passes. Practice making quick, crisp, accurate passes with your teammates and moving quickly down the field to keep the defense off balance. Though the player in possession has 10 seconds to hold onto the Frisbee, it should be a rarity that a player holds the Frisbee for longer than five. Don't worry about making \"hail mary\" passes that launch all the way down the field. These types of passes are low-probability and will more often result in picks, than in long point opportunities.  ", " Let your quick teammates run onto the passes. Throwing a pass directly to a stationary player is a good way of getting your Frisbee toss picked off by the defense and losing possession. Instead, practice leading your teammates, passing into open space, and allowing your teammates to outrun the defense and run down the Frisbee. This is a more effective technique of moving possession down the field and gathering territory. ", " Don't rush it. Unless you see a great opportunity, you don't need to charge down the field as soon as you grab the Frisbee. Focus on making high-probability passes and controlling the possession of the disc, not in scoring immediately. If you've got the Frisbee, possess it. Make crisp and accurate passes and move down the field gradually, gaining territory. Like in soccer, you can move in any direction when you've got possession of the disc. If you need to make a few passes backward to regroup and control the field, do so. You generally want to be going forward and not back, but it can be a good way of strategizing.  ", " Move to open space. When you're not in possession of the Frisbee, you need to be constantly moving into open space, looking to get open. Spread out. Make cuts, juke out your defenders, and hustle, hustle, hustle. Learn to make crossing patterns in your cuts, taking short routes across the path of the player in possession of the disc, rather than moving parallel. This will result in higher probability passes and help you control the disc. It gives the player in possession more options.  ", " Practice pattern routes. Like in basketball, soccer, or almost any team sport, it's important to have a few plays drawn up, especially when you get into scoring pattern. Whether you want to give them fancy names (\"Flying V on one, on one!\") or just run them on the down-low, moving the offense in pre-drawn patterns is a good way to juke out the defense and stay ahead of the game.  If the player in possession knows what kind of route you're likely to run, the passes can go to open space and allow players to run them down.  ", " Mark up player to player on defense. When you're playing defense, the best way to mark up is usually \"man-to-man,\" by marking up on one player for the whole game and sticking to them like glue. Defense should be played much as a combination of basketball and football, using your arms to disrupt the shots of the player you're guarding and trying to pick off passes. Defenders need to give the offensive player a bubble, at least a yard around the point of possession. You can't get in close enough to physically touch the player in possession of the disc. Remember: no contact. When you're running with players on defense, try to watch their hips instead of watching for the Frisbee. Stay between them and the player in possession of the disc, to give yourself the best chance of picking one off.  "]}}, "How to Throw a Frisbee Forehand": {"description": "The forehand, also known as the flick, the two-finger, or the side arm, is one of the two most common ways to throw a Frisbee. To throw a forehand, you'll have to \"flick\" your wrist forward while keeping the Frisbee parallel to the ground as it moves toward your opponent. This throw, similar to the forehand in tennis, can be a bit tricky to master, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to throw a disc with superior distance and accuracy. If you want to know how to throw a Frisbee forehand, see Step 1 to get started.", "content": {"Throwing a Regular Forehand": [" Grip the disc correctly. To properly grip the disc for the forehand, you'll need to use your thumb, index finger, and middle finger while keeping the other fingers out of the way. These three fingers alone should be enough to hold the weight of the disc and to give you the power and control you need. Here's how to grip the disc:  You'll need to stick your thumb out, thumbs up style, and make a peace sign with your index and middle finger, making sure your palm is facing the sky. These are the three fingers you'll need. Now, hold the disc with your left (or non-dominant) hand, logo side up, and place it over your \"peace sign\" fingers, while folding your thumb over the top of the disc. Then, fold your ring and pinkie fingers into your hand as if you were making a loose fist, just touching your palm, to keep them out of the way. Fold your middle finger toward your palm, pushing it against the inside of the rim. Your index finger should stay straight, pointed toward the center of the Frisbee, supporting some of its weight. Squeeze the disc, pushing your thumb down and your middle finger tight against the rim.  For a variation, instead of the \"split fingers\" grip, you can move your index and middle fingers together for the power grip, which will give you more power but less control.   ", " Get in the proper stance. Once you've got the grip down, you've got to step out, with your feet slightly more than shoulder width apart, pointing toward the receiver. Your knees should be slightly bent to help you maintain your balance and to gather power.  ", " Bring the disc back. Now, bring the disc back with your dominant hand while shifting your weight toward your throwing foot, so that about 80% of your weight is on your throwing foot, while 20% of your weight is on your other foot. Your arm should be close to parallel to the ground.  ", " Move the disc back behind your elbow. Keep bringing it back until your elbow is in front of the disc, pointing toward the receiver. Bend your wrist back as far as you can. When you snap it forward, it will generate the momentum you need to spin the disc.  ", " Keep the disc at a slight downward angle while moving it forward. The disc should be angled about 10 degrees downward parallel to the ground. Your throwing hand and arm should be parallel to the ground, with your other arm slightly behind you. You should increase the bend in your throwing foot a bit, too.  ", " Throw the disc. Now, flick your wrist as you move your throwing arm from the outside to the inside of your body (the opposite motion of throwing a backhand). The power should come from the shoulder, passing naturally through the elbow and into the wrist, allowing the disc to spin. When you throw the disc, make sure that you rotate your body, using your throwing side first, and then your shoulders. Use your non-throwing hand to balance your body after it rotates, to create balance as you move it out and behind you a bit.  You may be tempted to flip your wrist because of throwing balls or playing other sports. But for throwing a disc, you should keep your palm facing up toward the sky so the disc will come off flat instead of flipping over, which is a common problem many first-time forehand throwers have.  If you've ever skipped rocks, you can think of the wrist movement as being similar. In a sense, you are skipping the rocks by throwing a forehand, if this helps.  ", " Follow through. After you release the disc, make sure to point after its flight path with your hand, keeping it level, with your palm up. Keep your pinkie and your ring finger slightly bent up and your hand level. Continue to look at the receiver to make sure that your disc is headed on the right path.  "], "Throwing Other Forehands": [" Throw the high release flick. This is the same as a regular forehand, except you throw it above your shoulder, flicking your wrist and raising your arm on release. This is good for getting around other people.  ", " Throw the low release flick. This is essentially a very low forehand. Lunge to the side you're throwing on, sinking down as low as you can. Release the disc just inches from the ground, trying to get it under a defender's arms. Your elbow should just barely make it past your knee when you throw the disc. This is effective at all ranges, but a little bit tricky to master.  ", " Throw the \"pizza flip. \" This is used mostly for faking. Here, you start to do a regular forehand throw, but at the last minute, you rotate the disc counter-clockwise, under your throwing arm, by using just your middle finger to hold the disc. Then, you release the disc toward your dominant side, which will be perpendicular to the standard way you will throw the disc using a forehand.

There are plenty of companies that make official ultimate discs, but a few include Discraft, which seems to be the most popular, and Wham-O, who were the inventors of the original Frisbee Flying Disc. All official Ultimate Frisbee discs are flat on the top, with the outside sloping down to a vertical lip around the entire circumference of the disc.

These detailed instructions will teach you how to play the game to a professional standard. you can use the hoops to score in too!", "content": {"Steps": [" Have the team captains determine the order. Before teams take to the court, team captains need to meet to do the disc toss to determine who will pull first. To do this one person calls \u2018up\u2019 or \u2018down\u2019 while the other person tosses the disc. If the call is correct that team captain gets to choose whether they receive the disc first or pull. The other team captain then gets to choose which end they want to start at. If the call is incorrect the other team captain chooses whether they want to receive the disc or not. Pull (definition): The throw at the start of each point that initiates play.  ", " After the toss each team lines up four players (often a 3:1 ratio of men and women) on opposing baselines on the basketball court.  ", " Each player on the team pulling lines up opposite the person on the other team they wish to mark. Once organised, the person with the disc puts one hand in the air to signal that they are ready to commence play (this occurs at the beginning of every point). They must wait for someone on the opposing team to raise one hand in response before pulling. ", " The team with the disc then pulls. This is where they attempt to throw it as far down the court as they physically can. Afterwards, the other team takes possession. ", " The opposing team receiving the pull has two options: a) they can catch it and if they do they must play from that point, or b) they can leave it to hit the ground and then play the disc from where it lands. Dropping the pull in an attempted catch results in a turnover. If the pull lands inbounds and rolls out, it must be played on the sideline at the point where it went out. If the pull goes \u201cout on the full\u201d there are two options: a) put the disc into play on the sideline at the point where it went out, or b) put the disc into play from the middle of the court perpendicular to the point where it went out. For option b, you must signal your intentions by raising one arm in the air before picking up the disc.  ", " The first person to pick up the disc after a pull must check it into play. They do this by either a) waiting for a defender to tap the disc and yell \u2018disc in\u2019, or b) a self-check where they tap the disc onto the ground. After checking the disc they are able to throw it to another team member. This is similar to basketball rules when the ball must be checked into play at the beginning of a point. ", " Offence is prohibited from running with the disc. Upon receiving the disc, they must come to a complete stop before passing to another player. By passing from player to player, offence is attempting to work the disc up the court towards their endzone. Offence (definition): The team with possession of the disc. Endzone (definition): The area in which a team catches the disc in, in order to score. ", " If a player catches the disc on the line it is out. If the disc comes into contact with anything that is out of bounds, such as a spectator, then it is out. When catching the disc the player must ensure their first point of contact with the ground after making a catch is in bounds, otherwise a turnover ensues. If your first point of contact is in but your momentum carries you out, you must return to the point where you went out before carrying on play. If you land with one foot out and one foot in, you are straddled and this is out. Also, dropping the disc due to contact with the ground is a turnover. A receiver must make as few steps as possible to come to a complete halt when catching the disc otherwise this is travel.

Fake (definition): A pretend movement one way to fool your defender opening up space on the opposite side. ", " When offence has the disc, defenders must each have a player to mark. Similar to man-on-man marking in hockey. The idea is that offence will not want to pass a disc to a player who is being marked closely. Therefore, offence players need to get free of their defenders by cutting. Cutting (definition): An attempt to get free to receive the pass. It begins with a fake then followed by a sudden change of direction and speed. Man-on-man (definition): The most common type of defence. It is where a defence player marks an offence player and attempts to stay as close as possible to the player in order to receive an intercept or forcing a mistake.

They begin by saying \u2018stalling, one, two\u2026\u2019 The player holding the disc has just seven seconds to pass it to a teammate.

Turnover (definition): change of possession.
