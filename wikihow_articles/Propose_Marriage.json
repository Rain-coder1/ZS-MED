Not surprisingly, you may feel a lot of pressure to get every last detail right. There\u2019s no single perfect way to propose, though; instead, focus on personalizing your proposal to suit your partner perfectly. After that, practice what you\u2019re going to say and work on calming your nerves so you can truly enjoy the experience!", "content": {"Personalizing the Proposal Details": [" Keep your partner in mind during every aspect of your planning. Your proposal should be tailored to suit your partner perfectly. Instead of trying to copy or one-up what other couples have done, ask yourself the following throughout the entire planning process: \u201cWill they love it?\u201d  For instance, if you know your partner hates being the center of attention, definitely don\u2019t propose on the big screen at a sporting event. On the other hand, if you know they\u2019d get a thrill out of having 50,000 people watching them say \u201cyes,\u201d go for it!   ", " Factor your partner's culture and family practices into your planning. Keep in mind that marriage proposal traditions vary widely around the world, especially if your partner comes from a different place or background than you. Do your homework and make sure your proposal respects their traditions, as well as any requirements you may have.  For example, the engagement ring is not a universal symbol. Nor is bending down on one knee while proposing. If possible, talk to your partner\u2019s family to get advice on the best way to propose. Even if there isn\u2019t an expectation that you should get their blessing first, they\u2019ll appreciate being informed of your plans to propose.  ", " Stick to tradition if you know that\u2019s your partner\u2019s preference. If tradition is important to them, make it important for you when planning the proposal. For instance, it may be important for you to talk to their parents first, get a diamond ring, take them to a fancy restaurant, get down on one knee, and specifically ask \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d  If you\u2019re not sure if they expect a traditional proposal, pay attention to how they respond to proposals involving friends or even celebrities. You might even ask, \u201cSo, what did you think of that proposal?\u201d  ", " Make it a modern proposal if that suits your partner better. Not everyone dreams of the \u201cfairy tale\u201d proposal that fits all the traditions of their culture. Use your deep knowledge of your partner\u2019s perspectives and preferences to guide your proposal planning. Remember, you goal should be to make it the perfect proposal for them!  If they have moral or economic objections to diamond rings, for example, you might go with a more basic ring style for one or both of you, or just skip using rings at all. So long as you know it suits your partner, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a marriage proposal being a sit-down conversation in which you talk through the pros and cons of this momentous step. You may even want to pair this more modern conversation with a more traditional proposal after you\u2019ve agreed to get married. In many societies around the world, it\u2019s still strongly assumed (and often preferred) among heterosexual couples that the man proposes. But keep in mind that this proposal is about doing things the way that works best for the two of you.  ", " Get input on your partner's ring preferences, if applicable. The engagement ring is a crucial part of the proposal for many couples. To make sure you get it right, you may want to actively browse for rings with your partner. This, however, can ruin some of the surprise, so you may want to work a little more surreptitiously.  For instance, watch for what kind of jewelry (especially rings) they\u2019re drawn to when passing by a jewelry store in the mall. Or, take notice of which of their friends\u2019 engagement rings they rave about. If you get the chance, trace the inner circumference of a ring your partner already owns on a piece of paper. If you bring this to the store, the jeweler can estimate the correct ring size.  ", " Get help capturing and celebrating the event, if desired. If you want to make sure your proposal is captured expertly for all posterity, hire a photographer or videographer to cover the event. (Alternatively, rely on a friend or family member with great camera skills.) You should probably only do this if you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll get a \u201cyes,\u201d though!  If you\u2019re really stuck trying to figure out the right way to propose, consider hiring a wedding planner to help plan your proposal. Even in this case, however, make sure the proposal is personalized to suit your partner perfectly.

However, if your still talk about the future only in \u201cme\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d terms, you may want to wait for the relationship to develop further.  When you discuss important life decisions with future implications\u2014buying a house, changing jobs, getting a pet, relocating, etc.\u2014do you treat them as joint decisions that will affect both of you?

You probably don\u2019t want to ask, \u201cHey, if I asked you to marry me, would you say \u201cyes\u201d?\u201d Therefore, you\u2019ll have to use your best judgment about the status of the relationship to determine when the time is right.

Keep your priorities straight\u2014your main goal is to ask this person to become your spouse, not to create the coolest proposal ever...right? If the idea of the spectacle is more exciting to you than the thought of actually proposing, you may want to consider whether you\u2019re truly ready to take this giant step.  Think of it this way: every proposal that ends with a \u201cyes\u201d becomes a great story to tell. The most spectacular proposal that ends with a \u201cno\u201d doesn\u2019t make a great story\u2014at least not for you!

They may feel they have no choice but to agree, despite their internal doubts. This is hardly the foundation for a successful engagement and (if you get there) marriage.  You can make a public proposal if both of the following are true: your partner will get a kick out of it; and, you\u2019re confident you\u2019d also get a \u201cyes\u201d if you asked them privately.

Or, take them to a romantic spot they\u2019ve been dreaming of seeing\u2014maybe the top of the Eiffel Tower? Use your knowledge of your partner to pick a spot they\u2019ll love.  Not everyone prefers an exotic location or a fancy restaurant, of course. If they\u2019d prefer a private proposal in their apartment, go for it\u2014it will still be memorable to them!  "], "Proposing Smoothly and Confidently": [" Practice what you want to say before the big day arrives. No matter how sure you are of the answer you\u2019ll get, you\u2019re going to be nervous during the proposal. Write down what you want to say, practice it in the mirror several times, and memorize it. You want it to sound completely natural when you say it during the proposal.  In most cases, it\u2019s best to keep things brief. Aim for 2-4 sentences, likely with the classic \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d request at the end. For example: \u201cAnnie, the past 2 years have been the happiest of my life because of you. I want to spend the rest of my life doing my best to make you happy. Annie, will you marry me?\u201d Or: \u201cWhen I think about my life before I met you, Annie, it feels like I\u2019m spying on someone else\u2019s memories.

Keep your ultimate goals in mind: to express your love and your desire to be by your partner\u2019s side for life, and for them to say \u201cyes\u201d! Instead of fretting over the details as the proposal happens, look into your partner\u2019s eyes. Say what you want to say with true feeling. Listen to their response closely.

But sometimes, marriage is not a good choice. There are many good reasons for rejecting a proposal: uncertainty that this is a solid marriage partner, not really knowing one another well enough, wondering if the person asking really means it, or that it is the timing is right. When it comes to a life decision, never say \"yes\" when you should say \"no\"; an honest response allows you both to make the best decision about the future.", "content": {"Deflecting an Upcoming Proposal": [" Be clear on why you do not want to get married. It is perfectly OK to have a \"gut feeling\" that the marriage would not be successful and simply go on that. However, it is even better to be clear to yourself what your concerns are. If you're simply nervous about making such a big commitment (which is not uncommon) try reading the advice in How to overcome the fear of marriage . If you're concerned that you and your mate are not compatible in some way, it's important to address your worries as soon as possible, long before your partner gets down on their knee. Think about these aspects of the relationship in advance so you're prepared to have a serious conversation: Does the relationship feel serious and permanent to you, or more lighthearted or temporary? If the other person takes it much more seriously than you do, it could be difficult to find a path together. Is this a time in life where marriage would derail the path that you've set in mind for yourself? Could you see yourself marrying your partner at a later date? Do you have strong opinions about marriage in general? Would you rather live together unmarried, or live separately even in a committed, loving relationship? Do you have concerns about your partner's approach to having children, running a household, financial habits, career goals, or other \"big picture\" items that would make marriage or cohabitation difficult? Do you have other concerns about your partner or your relationship that are relevant whether or not your get married? These should be discussed as soon as possible, even if marriage is off the table.   ", " Do not play along with the hints. In an ideal world, the topic of marriage would come up without mind games. However, since this is an emotional issue many people will test the waters before they propose. This may come in jokes, veiled comments, or other subtle \"hints\". If your significant other raises the issue of marriage, even casually, make your position clear but polite. Or call him or her out to clarify. For example, if your partner comments while house-hunting: \"This house would be perfect for a married couple,\" hint back with another option: \"Or for an unmarried couple too.\" Or, be more direct: \"Honey, you keep making comments about married couples and such. Are you trying to tell me something? I'd rather you be direct with me instead of making confusing comments.\"  ", " Head him or her off before the proposal. Asking a person to have his or her hand in marriage comes with a lot of emotional weight. This may happen in public, such as a restaurant, an athletic stadium, your family's Christmas dinner, or some cleverly elaborate choreographed manner. And to have to turn a person down after all that dramatic build up can be humiliating for the person proposing. If the hints start coming thick and strong, or you discover a ring hidden somewhere, try have a discussion before the proposal happens. Remember that the purpose of this discussion is information. You should each find out what the other person thinks, not try to persuade them into changing their mind.  If your partner cannot set the topic aside, or you cannot agree on a short-term path forward, visit a relationship counselor for advice. Or you may have to part ways.  ", " Deflect pressure from other people. Sometimes it can feel like parents, friends, or even complete strangers are eager to whip out a marriage license and hand you a bouquet of flowers. In the end, your decision is not their business, and you do not owe them anything more than basic politeness when deflecting these questions or suggestions: A polite \"We don't have any plans right now\" is a good first step, or \"I'll let you know whenever something changes\". Humor can help relieve tension among family members and close friends who are constantly pressuring you: \"I hear they're inventing a new color wedding dress, I'm going to wait a few years for it to hit the market.\" Try acting stiff if strangers or acquaintances do not take the hint: \"Our relationship is fine, thanks for your concern.\"  ", " Consider the future. If you and your partner have both gotten through the conversation (perhaps with help from a counselor), you've bought yourself some time. This is often exactly what you need, but use this time wisely. If it's just a question of reevaluating after finishing your education, you may be content just to see what happens. If you have doubts about the relationship itself, think carefully about whether to stay together , continue to discuss issues with your partner, and seek advice from a relationship counselor if necessary, or from non-judgmental friends who are in healthy relationships and who won't spread gossip.  If there are life events that would seriously pressure you to get married, spend time planning for this in advance. Some events you can do your best to avoid, such as pregnancy, while others you cannot control, such as a terminal illness in the family. Seeking advice and support is especially important in these situations, when you feel pressured to make a decision under stress.  Do not make decisions because of another family member. Yes, Grandma would love to see you get married before she dies. But she does not have to live with the consequences of marrying the wrong person, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. And imagine how bad she would feel, knowing the reason for your (likely) divorce, was because she pressured you into the marriage. An out-of-wedlock and/or accidental pregnancy can be problematic. But getting married for the sake of the baby often ends poorly, too.   "], "Rejecting a Proposal": [" Don't mislead with your body language. Try not to smile when proposed to, or at least not to beam and look excited. If your mate has gone as far as to pop the question, they are assuming you will say yes, and your smiling will only confirm their hopefulness, which will make the shock of your rejection greater. Look in your partner's eyes tenderly, put your hand over theirs, and give your response in a gentle voice. ", " Handle a public proposal. If you are in public when proposed to, ask your suitor to stand up (if necessary), and give them a gentle hug. This is a way to acknowledge that you're touched by your partner's gesture, without saying yes. Hopefully, it is enough to make anyone who's watching lose interest and go back to doing whatever they were doing, which will help ease any embarrassment for your mate. If people are still watching, take your partner by the hand and quietly ask to go somewhere more private. Never say yes just to get out of the situation so you can give your real response later. This will just make the later rejection more painful.  ", " Stay positive but honest. This guide assumes you like the person proposing; if your ex from three years ago leaps out of the bushes holding a ring, \"say no and get out of there\" is all the advice you need. But if the suitor has reason to be hopeful, it's best to break the news gently, without being misleading. Say something appreciative, but keep it short so you can get to your response: \"That's such a moving request. I need time to think about it; it's not something I'd feel right saying yes to straight away. It's a bit of a surprise for me - would you mind if I take some time to think it over?\" \"Thanks, that's incredibly wonderful of you but I have so many questions that I've yet to ask you that I'm not sure of our future compatibility yet. Maybe this is a good time for us to sit down and talk about what spending a life together would look like.\" \"I love you for asking that, but I don't plan on getting married (for a while / ever). We could move in together instead?\" \"I'm honored that you've proposed to me. You're a kind, caring (man / woman). I wish I could say otherwise, but I can't see our marriage working out, and I have to say no.\"  ", " Respond to their unhappiness and confusion. It's likely that the person proposing has put in a lot of effort to asking, thinking through the depths of why they want to spend the rest of their life with you. Letting down their unhappiness gently isn't going to be easy, but there are ways you can help the process:  if either of you feels angry or too upset to talk. Let your partner know you'll be contacting them soon (preferably the same day or next morning), but give them time to think until then. Suggest the two of you do something you both love doing. If your partner wants affection from you, spend the rest of the day together doing something that keeps your occupied. This will serve as a distraction and it will help the other person realize that you still care.  ", " Explain your feelings. In private, and once neither of you are actively upset at each other, explain at length what the situation is. Emphasize that your relationship still matters a great deal to you. Describe exactly why you're not prepared to accept. Don't let the other person think it's because they're not good enough. If you have doubts about the relationship itself, not just marriage, be honest about this. It may not be the best time to air your grievances, but let your partner know that there are problems to discuss once you've both calmed down.  ", " Consider the way forward. Things can get really awkward from this point, or they can pick up as usual with good, caring approaches to continuing to nurture your love and relationship. If the proposer is able to accept your position (whether that's an alternative to marriage or delaying the decision for now), then the relationship will likely remain strong and forge on. On the other hand, if this rejection opens a rift in your relationship and causes suspicion, anger, resentment, or discomfort, it may be time to reassess the purpose of staying together. Unless it's clear that the relationship has ended, take a few weeks to sort through the post-proposal emotions before making a drastic decision. ", " Avoid making conditional agreements. Telling your partner that you'll say \"yes, if...\" is not about love or reasonable compromise. You may end up in the same situation a year from now, full of resentment that you backed yourself in a corner.

If you never want to get married, you need to tell your partner. They may be fine with it, they may not, but you owe it to them to be honest.   ", " Keep it quiet. If you decline the proposal, it is your obligation to keep the news to yourself. Politeness dictates that you should spare your partner the potential embarrassment and humiliation of others bringing up their rejection. If you want to tell someone about it, the right thing to do is to ask your partner if they mind first. Only tell people you trust not to spread the story around. A spurned proposal is exciting gossip, so make sure that it isn\u2019t being spread around needlessly.  "], "Rejecting an Unwelcome Proposal": [" Give a firm, but polite, \u201cno. \u201d If someone you do not have a particularly close relationship with proposes, or you are receiving repeated proposals despite rejecting them, the time for ambiguity is past. You are under no obligation to worry about hurting the feelings of someone who is stalking or harassing you. You don\u2019t need to explain yourself at all in this situation. They should respect your wishes, period.   ", " Keep your distance. While it may not always be possible, staying away from the source of unwanted advances can stop your troubles before they start. In this instance, a text-message rejection is not only appropriate, it may be advisable. You should not, however, be forced to change your life and routine because of this. If the other person\u2019s presence makes it difficult or dangerous to go about your business, you are likely being harassed and should take appropriate action.  ", " Ask a friend to be with you for support. Not only can they provide you with emotional help, they\u2019re also available as a witness to events and a deterrent in case things go badly. Make them fully aware of the situation. They need to know what they\u2019re getting into.  ", " Be prepared to call the police. In some cultures refusing a proposal can be downright dangerous, especially for women. If you think there is a chance of violence or other danger, be ready to call for help. If you are concerned for your safety, stay in a public, well-lit area. If you believe you are in imminent danger call 911 and stay on the line with the dispatcher until help arrives. You may consider keeping a small self-defense tool on hand, such as pepper spray, if local laws permit it.  "], "Refusing a Public, Surprise Proposal": [" Give unsubtle hints that you would not like a highly public proposal. The time to prevent the ballpark jumbotron proposal is before it starts.  If you see a public proposal together on a television show or movie, say something along the lines of \u201cWow. I would absolutely hate it if someone did that to me. It\u2019s so tacky.\u201d If your partner needs a more obvious example of why a public proposal is a bad idea, watch any of the dozens of public-proposals-gone-wrong videos that are widely available online. Fear of humiliation can be a powerful motivator.  ", " Do your best to recover from the surprise quickly. If you do receive a proposal in a highly public setting like a ballpark, it\u2019s very likely that many sets of eyes, and even cameras, are watching your every move. Every second you take to get over the shock adds to the tension.  Concentrate on your breathing to quickly regain some composure. Identify a way out. Look for a door, a concourse, or even a natural barrier like trees or bushes. Having an escape route available will help reduce feelings of panic.   ", " Quickly ask them to go somewhere private to talk. You want to get out of the public eye in an expeditious manner so you can talk things over with less pressure.  Do your best to control your body language and facial expressions, and suggest to your partner that \u201cI would much rather talk about this privately,\u201d or that \u201cI want to answer you, but I\u2019m too nervous in front of all these people.\u201d Try not to give the impression that the answer will be \u201cno\u201d until you\u2019re safely out of sight. Any answer that isn\u2019t an immediate \u201cyes\u201d will have your proposer worried and stressed, so do not add to it if you can help it.

Regardless of how well (or disastrously) your refusal went, everybody in the immediate area is going to recognize you and maybe even ask you about what happened. Don\u2019t give them the opportunity. A modest disguise can help. Put on, or take off, a hat or sunglasses, or make other quick, minor changes to your appearance. People that only had a quick glimpse of you may not recognize you afterward. Find the back door, or another exit from the area that isn\u2019t crowded. You don\u2019t want to have to shoulder your way through a throng of humanity while making your escape.

Gauge what kind of proposal your partner would like by talking to their friends and family, and factoring in their favorite things and personality type. Save for and buy a beautiful engagement ring to present to your partner during the proposal. Pop the question in a way that honors your history as a couple, or make an impression by recreating a proposal scene from one of their favorite movies. If you have a trip planned, propose on vacation (or plan a trip with that goal in mind), or get your friends and family involved. If you really want to go big, consider hiring romantic event planners.", "content": {"Figuring Out Your Partner's Ideal Proposal": [" Ask their friends and family. Friends and family who have known your partner for a long time will likely have an idea if they have a dream proposal, and what it might include. For instance, your partner's siblings may recall your partner talking about how wonderful it would be to receive a marriage proposal on a beach, at sunset. As an added bonus, informing other people about your intention to propose means that you can enlist their help with planning the occasion. Friends and family can also inform you if your partner has expressed dislike of certain traditional proposals (e.g. on the big screen at a baseball game). Ask a question like, \"Has Jane ever told you anything about what her ideal proposal would be?\"   ", " Make a list of their favorite things. When planning your proposal, make a list of some of your partner's favorite things and try to incorporate them into your plan. The event will be all the more memorable if your partner is surrounded by things they love while they are being proposed to. Some things to add to your list should include their favorite: Flowers Music Food or dessert Drink (alcoholic or otherwise)  ", " Factor in their personality. Take your partner's personality type into account before planning a proposal. If your partner is outgoing and adventurous, a grandiose, public proposal is an excellent idea. If they are shy or very private about things, plan a more intimate proposal that will be memorable for its sentimental value.  Spend time reflecting on your partner's morals, values, beliefs, likes and dislikes and design the proposal based on these qualities. Make the proposal about honoring your partner and your relationship, not just the things that like. You might think a proposal in front of thousands of people would be cool, but your partner might find it embarrassing. For example, you might try writing a love letter to your shy partner that ends in a proposal. Either have them read it, or read it to them in a quiet, romantic setting. The letter will also make a perfect keepsake. If your partner is adventurous and outgoing, try to make arrangements for a proposal on-stage at a big event, like a concert or sporting event.  "], "Choosing a Ring": [" Save money. Save up for an engagement ring well in advance so that you can buy it without taking a bit hit financially. Open a dedicated saving account without an ATM card, so that you won't feel tempted to spend any of the money in it. You can also consider saving money in small ways over a period of two to three months by:  Selling unwanted items on websites like Craiglist or Ebay Cutting back on unnecessary expenses (e.g. dining out) Buying generic products whenever possible Optimizing your cell phone plan to prevent monthly overpaying  ", " Make the most of your budget. There are many small ways to cut down the cost of an engagement ring. These options can be discussed with jewelers when you are shopping for the ring. Ask about:  Emerald cut stones, which cover a larger surface of a ring than other stones A halo setting, a circle of small stones around a center stone, which makes the middle stone look larger Pave diamonds, tiny diamonds that add extra sparkle to the setting or band of an engagement ring for less  ", " Customize the ring. Choosing a ring that your partner will love means considering their tastes before deciding on anything. If they haven't already told you about what they'd like their engagement ring to look like, take clues from elsewhere, and consider having it engraved to make the gesture extra special. Think about the jewelry that they already own and wear frequently, and note if it is: Bold or understated Yellow gold, white gold, platinum, or silver (and choose a metal that will match) More circular or square in shape (e.g. necklace charms or earrings)  ", " Present the ring creatively. Presenting an engagement ring to your partner in a surprising, creative way can make your proposal especially memorable. Be unsuspecting by hiding the ring in a box much larger than the ring box, or in a bottle of champagne. Alternatively, be romantically obvious by getting down on one knee, holding up the ring box, and opening it in front of your partner. "], "Making It Meaningful": [" Honor your history. To create a memorable wedding proposal, do something that acknowledges a milestone in your relationship with your partner. For instance, consider proposing at the first restaurant you ever brought them on a date, or while playing the first song that you ever danced with them to. Make sure that the memory is significant enough that your partner will recognize it instantly.  Propose at the place that you first fell in love with your partner (e.g. the cafe where you both worked at the time). Make a scrapbook of your best photographs and memories together and write your proposal out on the last page. Set up a screening of the first movie you saw together (e.g. in your living room, or on a projector in your backyard) and propose during the movie. Try writing a simple proposal speech that highlights the things you love about your partner and the special, private details that make your relationship unique. Include every quality about them that you love, and why you want them to be your spouse.  ", " Replicate a romantic movie scene. If one of your partner's favorite movies or television shows features a romantic wedding proposal, consider replicating it. What they love about a movie is a good indication of what they would appreciate in real life. Reproduce the venue, props, and set-up, and don't worry about pulling it off flawlessly- a proposal with a comedic tinge will be just as memorable and charming.  For instance, try replicating the proposal in Love Actually for a grandiose effect. Have a large group of friends or family follow you (as the villagers trail Colin Firth's character in the film) and make a heartfelt speech to your partner in broken Portuguese to ask for their hand in marriage. If your partner is a fan of the film, this will be funny, romantic, and memorable.  ", " Propose on vacation. If you and your partner have a trip planned together, make the most of the opportunity to propose while you are away. Your proposal can essentially piggyback on the excitement of travel, and is bound to be something out of the ordinary and truly memorable (e.g. proposing in front of the Bellagio fountain in Las Vegas, Nevada). There is also the added bonus of popping the question at a grandiose tourist spot that you and your partner would be visiting anyway, giving your proposal the element of surprise while maintaining the magic of the setting (e.g. the Eiffel tower in Paris or the Grand Canyon in Arizona).  When preparing for your trip, budget extra money for supper at a nice restaurant, or a bottle of champagne to celebrate your new engagement.  ", " Get friends and family involved. Share the joy of your proposal by getting friends and family involved. Either pop the question at a family dinner or event, or invite friends and family to the venue where you plan to propose. For the best of both worlds, opt to propose one-on-one and then bring out everyone as a surprise- this will give you two an intimate moment and allow for everyone to share in your happiness right after.  Approach family and friends by saying something like, \"I am proposing to Tim, and I would love it if you could be a part of the event.\"  ", " Hire a romantic event planner. If you have the cash and are certain your partner would love something big and less intimate, hire a company that will help you customize and pull off an elaborate proposal that will create a huge impact. Proposal packages range greatly in price depending on what your wishes are \u2014 for example, The Heart Bandits, a romantic event planning company in the U.S., has proposal packages for between $300 to $2,500. Alternatively, Brilliant Event Planning, a company with offices in New York City and Boston, offers services that start at $500 and has charged up to $50,000 for customized proposals.

Your couple is getting married, and in many novels, it wouldn't make sense for them to marry a person they'd never even met before with no explanation as to why. Make sure you've written in backstory to this proposal before writing it, as it will make the proposal make a lot more sense. Not every wedding is because the couple is in love. Some weddings are arranged marriages, while others are for \"the greater good\" - for example, one character is being threatened by a powerful villain and the only way to stop the villain is to marry someone, possibly even the villain! Even if your story has an aspect that makes it so that strangers get married - for example, if a person in the novel's universe grows older than a certain age, they're automatically married to someone regardless of whether they know them or not - make sure that the readers are aware of this. If it's put in the book with no warning, the reader will just be confused.   ", " Set up the scene. A proposal in a fast-food joint might be humorous, but it's not very classy.

Rain was pattering down onto the ground and sliding down the window - the same window that Brad and Lisa had been poised at, watching the rain. Brad's hands were clenched in his pockets - one pocket being the one that held a small, velvety ring box. Now was the perfect time to propose - he knew that, he'd seen it all the time in those romance stories. But did someone go about doing that? Did they just pull out the ring and go, \"Will you marry me?\", or wait for the other person to talk first? There were so many questions left unanswered for Brad, all of which left his heart hammering in his chest, but the biggest unanswered question for Brad was,  It was Kaori's first time out with her girlfriend since the two had gotten together, Allison remembered. No wonder Kaori was so afraid. A small prickle of guilt tugged at the blonde girl - she'd thrown Kaori's life for a loop and had forced her into dating her, just because the Shadow had threatened to hurt everyone she ever cared for unless she destroyed her engagement with her arranged fianc\u00e9. She didn't even to marry Kaori - she didn't see the autistic girl as more than a close friend - but she knew she had no other choice. She knew it was for everyone's safety - for everyone's .

Put in a twist to the writing, and detail the scene well. Take a look at the examples below for some examples of better writing of a proposal scene. \"Lisa,\" Brad said suddenly, and his girlfriend turned to look at him. He was sweating, it was obvious, but he didn't care; this was his moment of bravado. He whipped the ring box out of his pocket so fast that Lisa couldn't make out what it was, and rapidly changed his position from sitting on the couch to kneeling on the floor with the box in his hands. Lisa's eyes widened and her mouth gaped as Brad sputtered, \"I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?\" The blonde-haired girl turned to Kaori, who was wringing her hands around the rubber band she often carried. \"Kaori. What if we got married? If we got married, I could break off the engagement my parents arranged for me.\" But Kaori stood there silently, looking at her girlfriend uncertainly. The look of sheer terror on her face at the idea left the other one stunned. \"And I really do love you, Kaori,\" she added softly. \"I'll love you no matter how you answer this question: Do you want to get married?\" \"Fool,\" the Shadow snarled in William's face, drool splattering the corners of his mouth. \"Fool! I could you! I could destroy the ! I'm giving you to save everyone you love - - and all you have to do to save is marry me!\"  ", " Describe the reaction to the proposal. Not all marriage proposals end in a happy, tearful \"yes\" - some end much differently. Feel free to experiment around, but try to make sure it fits how the character would most likely react. Lisa had her hand cupped over her mouth to try and hide her shock, but Brad could see from her eyes that she was smiling. Slowly, her head bobbed up and down in a nod, and she kneeled down, pushed the ring box down a bit, and kissed her now-fianc\u00e9, waiting for him to slide the ring onto her finger. Kaori diverted her gaze, starting to rock back and forth on her feet, like she always did when she was nervous. \"I... Allison, you...\" She turned her head back towards Allison, but didn't quite meet her eyes. \"I mean, I accept, but... ?\" William delivered a sharp slap to the Shadow's face, leaving him stunned. \"For the record,\" William started, the boy's high-pitched voice breaking the angry fog in the room, \"I know you're a liar. I know you can't do of the things you say you can. And I'm not going to give up my life for a liar - for an abusive, awful person. No, I marry you.\"  ", " Proofread. It's always important to proofread what you've written to make sure you don't have any errors. Go through the scene at least twice - once looking for obvious errors or plot holes, and the second time looking for smaller things such as spelling mistakes, grammar errors, messed-up punctuation, and so forth. If you're writing on a computer, turn on your spellchecker. This can help you discern typos and grammar mistakes much more easily than if you have it off. Software meant for writing, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs, will usually have this on by default.  ", " Have a trusted friend proofread.

You can use captions or text boxes at the bottom of your presentation to show just how much she means to you. At the end of the presentation, you could show the question \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d along the bottom of the screen with a video clip or image of you holding out the ring to the camera. Then you can mimic the gesture in real life, so when she turns from the video, there you are, on bended knee holding out her ring. To add some extra surprise to your proposal, you might use some help from others and have your marriage proposal played somewhere she won't expect. This might be at an awards banquet, before a movie at a theater, or even at a family party. Use some kind of excuse, like a DVD marathon, to set the trap for your proposal. Make sure it's realistic, otherwise she might know you\u2019re up to something! Prepare , order her favorite meal, or maybe make her a favorite snack. When you\u2019ve both settled in, play the DVD, and get ready to fish her engagement ring out of your pocket.   ", " Propose using an aerial banner. An aerial banner is a long streamer attached to the back of an airplane. These are often used as advertising gimmicks, and can be seen at beaches, athletic events, and parks. An aerial advertising company near you can be found through an online search, or perhaps even through contacting the customer services of your local airport. Before contacting an aerial advertising company, you\u2019ll need to think of the message you want on the banner. Something short and sweet, like \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d will save you money, but you may want to use your own words. Remember, messages that are too long might be difficult to read up in the sky! You\u2019ll also need to think of a suitable, wide-open space where you and your partner will be able to see the message. A public park, a local pier that juts out from a waterfront, or a similar location might work well for viewing your banner. If you notice her look up, get ready to bend your knee and pop the question, but you might have to direct her gaze by saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s that up there?\u201d While she\u2019s looking up and reading the message, get on one knee and extend her ring toward her. A common variation on the banner proposal is skywriting. This is where an airplane uses special smoke that hangs in the air for a period of time to spell out a message. For more information, you should look into how to arrange a marriage proposal in skywriting.   ", " Propose with a photo album or scrapbook book. Especially if your beloved is a fan of scrapbooks and mementos, a physical compilation of your good times and the love you have shared can also be used to propose. Gather photos, items that remind you of time spent together, and other supplies to create a proposal scrapbook . At the end of your scrapbook, you might write the message \u201cWill you marry me\u201d along with an arrow pointing toward the side of her which you plan on sitting. When she reaches this page, kneel and hold up your ring so that when her eyes follow the arrow, she sees that it\u2019s pointing to her ring. A might be a good alternative for the more technologically adept. You can upload your pictures from social media or other places, or to use in your digital scrapbook. You might even include the ring as part of the scrapbook. You can use the clear plastic of your scrapbook to form a pouch for your ring on the last page along with your proposal message. This way, when she turns the last page, all you need to do is bend your knee and wait for her eyes to meet yours. Then you can ask, \u201cWill you?\u201d to hear her reply.   ", " Propose with a favorite food or drink. A ring can be the perfect ornament to top an elegant desert, to hide in the bottom of a celebratory drink, like champagne, or to hide as a prize in a favorite snack. You might hide your ring in a plastic egg to keep it clean, then place the egg as a prize in a box of her favorite treats. If you are planning on proposing during a fancy dinner, you might want to bring the restaurant in on your plans. This way the wait-staff can help you make your proposal go as smoothly as possible. The chef could place the ring artfully on a desert platter, or your server might distract your partner so you can secretly slip the ring into her glass. Be careful when hiding your ring as a \u201cprize\u201d in a box containing a favorite snack or candy. There\u2019s always a chance that the prize could be missed! Be sure you are on the scene to prevent any mishaps or accidental ring disposals.   ", " Propose with a favorite TV show, book, or movie series. Your partner may be especially fond of a TV, movie, or book series that you can employ in your wedding proposal. You could recreate a scene and use your ring and proposal as its climax, you could use a prop from the series to present your ring, or you could propose in a way the characters of the series might. If your girlfriend is a fan of the Dr. Who series, you could hide your ring in a Tardis cookie jar. Since a running joke about the Tardis is \u201cIt\u2019s bigger on the inside,\u201d you might attach a note to the ring you\u2019ve placed inside the Tardis that says, \u201cAnd so is my heart when you\u2019re with me. Will you marry me?\u201d  If your girlfriend is and avid reader and you know she is planning on rereading her favorite series, you could buy an extra copy of the book and and then store the ring inside with a message. This way, when she opens it up to read, she\u2019ll see your proposal. You can earn bonus points by using her old copy for the hollowed out proposal and buying a signed copy to replace the one you destroyed. For a fan of Lord of the Rings, you could arrange a massive theme party in the style of Bilbo\u2019s final birthday celebration. Then, much as Bilbo passed the ring onto Frodo, you can present your beloved with her engagement ring at the end of the party. You might even say something like, \u201cJust as there was only ever one ring, you will always be the only one for me.\u201d   ", " Propose with flowers. Flowers are a common romantic gift exchanged between partners, but you can use these creatively to convey the depths of your love. You might send a rose each day for 11 days, and save your proposal for the 12 . She\u2019ll most likely be expecting a final rose to finish of the dozen, but you could present her with a full dozen on the 12 day, along with a ring and your proposal. You might communicate your feelings by spelling out a message with flowers or petals. Be careful when doing so, as some petals and flowers can stain fabric. Light some candles to add a romantic ambiance and make your proposal extra special. Make a mix-and-match message proposal with flowers. Buy 14 of her favorite blooms and attach a piece of paper to the stem of each. On each paper, write a single letter of the 14 letter phrase \u201cWill you marry me\u201d and send them to her one at a time or hide them around the house. Time your deliveries so that she receives a flower every hour on the hour throughout the day. Then, when the 12 hour arises, you can make an appearance with the final flower of the bouquet, your ring, and your proposal to her.   "], "Proposing at a Scenic Location or Event": [" Propose at the place you first met. This one won\u2019t need as much preparation simply because this place will be special already to both of you. You can make her think it\u2019s a casual date by pretending you don\u2019t remember the significance of the spot. But when you\u2019ve finally arrived, you may want to start talking about the time you first met as a lead in to your proposal. Some topics you might want to use to set the tone for your proposal include: what you thought about her the first time you saw her, what makes her special to you, and how she still makes you feel. You might also bring up particular moments that you shared where you overcame an obstacle or you spent your time together enjoyably. Set out candles or other romantic touches. If you first met at a park, you might have a blanket laid out close to the exact location you met. Scatter your blanket with some sweet smelling blossoms to up the romantic appeal. She\u2019ll think you\u2019re just being charming, but when you ask her to marry you, she\u2019ll likely think you\u2019re her one and only.   ", " Propose in a luxurious hotel. A special occasion will make the extravagance of a hotel stay a little less suspicious to her. You might tell her it\u2019s for her birthday or your own. You could plot to spring this proposal around the time of your anniversary or some other special date that you celebrate together. Call or text her and let her know you\u2019ve arranged a hotel reservation for the two of you. To make it an even bigger surprise, don\u2019t tell her any more than she needs to know. Inform her of the date, time, and room number. Then you can leave the door unlocked so she can walk in. But Before she does, you should arrange the room for maximum romance. This might mean playing soft, sweet music in the background, or even leaving a trail of scattered flower petals to a balcony with a table set for two. Then, when the moment is right, all you have to do is ask. Some hotels might have services in place for wedding proposals. While you are booking your hotel, you should let the person handling your reservation know that you plan to propose to your soon-to-be spouse on this day. The booking agent might be able to suggest a more suitable room, or a special room service course that you and your partner can enjoy.   ", " Propose at a religious ceremony. Many religions look at the commitment of marriage as a commitment before the divine. If you and your girlfriend, or either of your parents, are religious, or if you want your proposal to have a sacred, reverential tone, you might propose before, during, or after a religious service. She might be even more pleasantly surprised if, following your proposal, her friends revealed they had been watching all along as part of the congregation. You\u2019ll want to coordinate your plans with the clergy presiding over the service to prevent any disturbances. Marriage is a joyous occasion, and sharing the start of that journey with fellow believers will likely be warmly regarded. You might even be able to play music on the sound system, or have the church band plan a special song leading up to or following your marriage proposal. You might want to involve the presiding minister and ask him or her to offer a blessing for your engagement. This is an easy way of leading into your proposal. First the minister can say some words of encouragement or offer a special message, and then turn the stage over to you for your special question.  Be certain this kind of proposal won't embarrass your hopeful bride to be! Public proposals can put pressure on her to say yes, even if she's not entirely certain.  ", " Propose using a scavenger hunt game. A scavenger game is sort of a treasure hunting game with map, clues, and other features. You can pretend this game is nothing more than a special date you\u2019ve planned for her or something you read about online that you thought might be fun. This way, she doesn\u2019t suspect that you\u2019re about to propose. You can also include your friends and tell them about your plan. Friends can help you think of clever clues for the hunt, set up those clues so they are ready for your girlfriend to find, and can even help you keep an eye on your partner\u2019s progress through text messages. Avoid making the questions for your scavenger hunt too difficult. You don\u2019t want to be waiting too long at the other end, but you also don\u2019t want your girlfriend getting frustrated along the way! While she\u2019s out finding and solving the clues you\u2019ve left, you can prepare the ending location to be extra romantic. Be careful where you arrange the scavenger hunt, the path should not contain anything hazardous. For example, you arrange for your girlfriend to walk across some rocks on the beach to find the next clue, but she ends up slipping and injuring her foot. Not very romantic! You might end your scavenger hunt at the beach, in a restaurant, a hotel room, at the place you first met, or anywhere you think she\u2019ll appreciate. When she\u2019s finally found you using the map, clues, and the hints you gave her, give her a reward she\u2019ll never forget \u2013 a small box with a ring inside. You can put a spin on the normal scavenger hunt by going geocaching instead! Geocaching is where an item is hidden somewhere no one will find without precise location information, like longitude and latitude. Or you might start off with a point and have this turn into a series of clues. Learn for more details.   ", " Propose during half-time game. Even if your wife-to-be isn\u2019t a big sports fan, she\u2019ll know how serious you are about your engagement when you do it in front of a stadium full of people! You\u2019ll have to contact stadium officials to see what the policy is for wedding proposals and how you might organize your proposal to be broadcast on TVs and screens across the entire stadium. You could arrange for a quick, heartfelt proposal before, during, or after the half-time break. After making the arrangements, all you need to do is , , and pop the question, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d Have your friends sit together on the other side of the stadium, and then when the moment is right, send them a signal, like a text message. Then your friends can lift up signs that spell out \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d When she notices the sign and wonders who is proposing, you take a knee and hopefully her hand in marriage, too.  Consider this kind of proposal carefully before putting it into action. Proposals in front of large crowds can be overwhelming. She might prefer a more intimate proposal  ", " Propose on live television. There are a number of TV shows out there that will use any excuse to add drama to the show. The most accessible kind of TV show for average people to join is most likely a game show. Game shows frequently use ordinary people to compete in challenges to win money and prizes. Of course, you won\u2019t really be joining the show for the prize money. You\u2019ve got a bigger prize in mind \u2013 her hand in marriage! You might want to discuss your proposal plans with the staff of the show beforehand. These people can help ensure you get you get the perfect chance to pop the question even if things go differently than planned. Win or lose the game, you\u2019ll still hopefully get the girl! Certain game shows choose candidates at random from the audience. Even if you can\u2019t get the gameshow staff to help you out with your proposal, they\u2019ll be hard-pressed to stop you if you\u2019re already in the audience. Simply plan your moment, and show her and the rest of the world you\u2019re ready to love her forever.  Live TV doesn't always go as planned. Be sure that this is the right way of proposing to your bride-to-be before you decide to pop the question on a live broadcast. Your girlfriend might say no, and then you both may go down in infamy.  ", " Propose during breakfast in bed. Some gals like a more laid back and intimate approach. You can spring your question on her following her favorite breakfast while staying at an opulent bed-and-breakfast. If a bed-and-breakfast isn\u2019t your style, do the same while in the comfort of your own home. Wake up early and leave bed as quietly as possible, add a few romantic touches, like rose petals on her breakfast tray, and when the moment is right, bend your knee and ask for her hand in marriage. Time your breakfast preparations to coincide with the time she normally wakes up. You don\u2019t want all your delicious food to get cold, or to awake her too soon and spoil her rest. You could also commemorate a day that\u2019s already special by adding your proposal to it. This way, she\u2019ll think that you\u2019re celebrating something else, like your anniversary, when you arrive with her tray and food. When you spring the question, she\u2019ll be extra surprised. Take some time to tell her how special she is and why you love her more than anyone else. Keep eye contact with her as you slowly kneel down on the floor beside the bed, open that small special box and ask her your question: \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d   ", " Propose while announcing a holiday you have paid for as a surprise. Take her somewhere that has sentimental value, or plan your trip for a romantic place she\u2019s always wanted to visit. When you surprise her with her holiday, present her with her ticket, but not the real one. Have a fake ticket with the words \"Will you marry me\" typed on it, or use your best handwriting and write out your message on an old ticket from a trip you went on together before. Buy refundable tickets. Even if you\u2019ve taken every precaution, there\u2019s always a small chance you could be rejected. As much as you might not want to think about this, it would be even more bitter to lose your lover have to foot the bill for a non-refundable trip for two. Come up with an excuse for your trip, like celebrating a recent accomplishment such as graduation or a promotion, and then surprise her with the engagement ring at an opportune moment. You might have a stewardess bring your girlfriend a glass of champagne with the ring inside, or you might arrange to have the captain announce your engagement to passengers on board.

This will be important for expressing your love to her at the proposal, as well as confirming to yourself that you're making the right decision. When you see your girlfriend, you should feel that you absolutely want to share the rest of your life with her, and that the time is right for you to tell her that.  Though they say, \"When you know, you know,\" this can be a little confusing. The important thing is that you propose because you genuinely want to, not because she's dropped so many hints about getting married that you don't want to disappoint her, not because you feel like you've been together long enough and that it's just about time for you to do something, not because everyone around you is getting engaged, and not because your friends, pastor, and family members keep putting the pressure on for you to propose. Many people believe that you should move in with your girlfriend for at least a few months before you know she's the one.

If you've only been together for a few months, make sure you know that she's in it for the long haul. Though many happily married couples got engaged after being together for only a few months, spending more time with your girlfriend to make sure that you're both the right people for each other can help you make sure she'll say yes.

It's important to get the timing right, and timing is really only something that you can work out. It's not possible to say that there are perfect times to propose, but it is important that you propose at a time when you're not rushed and when you feel calm, sorted, and ready. Once you've planned the proposal in as much detail as possible, then the time will be right. Here are some things to keep in mind: Is there a meaningful day to the both of you? Such as an anniversary of your relationship or first date, or some other commemoration? Sometimes the time chooses itself by sheer practicality, especially if the two of you are living in different cities and come together for a special holiday event and this is your only chance to ask her.  Consider the time of year she wants to get married. It's helpful to ask her or indirectly through her friends or family if there is a certain season, month, or length of time she wants to be engaged in order to plan the wedding without feeling overwhelmed or rushed. If she's mentioned that she wants a fall wedding, try proposing around that time the year before -- if you propose just a few months before the fall and she wants a bigger fall wedding, she may not like the idea of waiting well over a year to get married.

Consider romantic places such as the beach, a , a famous restaurant with an amazing view, a covered bridge, a picnic, etc.  Consider the safety of the location. A man once proposed to his girlfriend on a cliff; she said yes, but became so excited that she slipped and fell to her death. This is why you should always take safety into account when proposing to your lover. Consider the things the two of you love doing together. Perhaps this can serve as a source of inspiration, such as proposing when you're out , fishing, sailing, hiking, cycling, attending a sports event, traveling somewhere, etc. The benefit of proposing during something you love doing together is that she won't suspect that you'll be proposing, since it'll be part of your usual routine.

There are many possibilities and it's entirely up to you what you do but for some inspiration, here are some suggestions : Try the traditional pose. Bend down on one knee, take her hand in yours and ask her to . The beauty of this gesture is that it's universally recognized thanks to the movies, and it can be performed anywhere. Just note that if there are other people around, they'll be eavesdropping (kindly!), so expect their interest and support.  Get a sense of whether she'd like something public or a bit more private. Though many women are proposed to in public in the movies, in real life, most engagements are private. You may think it's a great idea to propose to hear at half-time during a sporting event or at an intimate party with several of your friends around, but she may be mortified by all of the attention. Plus, if it doesn't go well, you'll feel even worse in front of a bunch of people. Think about things that might accompany the occasion, such as a quartet playing a tune or a , or a tiny fireworks display, etc. These sorts of extras are not necessary and they will bloat the budget unless you've got willing friends to help out, but if it's your kind of thing, they can add to the atmosphere. Hide the ring. This is another popular method for proposing that requires her to find the ring, and then you do the proposing. Places to hide a ring include inside flowers, chocolates, or a special gift. Be sure to ask her to open the gift at the time, or you might be waiting ages! And take great care not to hide it somewhere that she can accidentally swallow it; that'll put a big dent in the occasion. Be creative. If you're not so traditional or you're not that keen to say the proposal yourself, there can be a number of other ideas for proposing that involve some more planning but can be really entertaining as well as confirming for her that you're the kooky guy she wants to spend the rest of her life with. You could prepare her very own word puzzle or crossword in which the final answer spells \"Will you marry me?\". You can do something small and cute involving children in your families, or even a pet that you own together. If you have the means and think she'll like it, you could have a plane write the question across the sky as the two of you are walking along. Proposing on a vacation is another popular move. If you do this, just make sure that she'll say yes! Nothing will make your vacation worse than a rejection on the first night. Perhaps use publicity, such as taking out an advertisement in the paper that you know she'll read, or getting her favorite radio DJ to announce the proposal, or place a big banner with the question on it over a bridge she drives under every day.   ", " Choose a ring. If you know what kind of ring your girlfriend wants, then great. But if you don't know or don't want to ask, get a temporary ring, and then get another after you propose; for many women, choosing their own ring is the preferred option. But if you know exactly what kind of ring she wants, then you should try to sneak out a ring she usually wears to get it sized and to find out her ring size. She'll be touched that you remembered exactly what she wanted -- and that you got it in the correct size! But if you have no idea what kind of ring she wants, asking her about it \"casually\" will pretty much let her know what's on your mind.  You don't have to blow a fortune on an engagement ring, especially if you really can't afford it. It's better to get something small and classy and to save for your future together instead of spending all your savings on a piece of jewelry.

If you're proposing on the beach, during a hike, skiing , or as you're skydiving, use your common sense about what to wear! ", " Rehearse . If you're going to propose, it pays to rehearse in advance. Practice asking, and practice explaining the reasons as to why you love her so much that you want to spend the rest of your life with her. This will help you avoid being tongue-tied when the important moment comes up. This doesn't mean you should put a lot of pressure on yourself. Though it helps to make your girlfriend feel extra special, in the end, she may only remember the words, \"Will you marry me?\" Keep the proposal simple, to the point, and from the heart. For example: \"Mel, I love you more than words can ever express. You're the most thoughtful, generous, kind, and beautiful woman I've ever had the fortune to know and I'd be honored to have the chance to spend my life with you. Will you marry me?\"  ", " Propose. There is no time like the present to move on with your carefully thought through plan. Bring her along to \"the place\" and start unfolding your plans. Be sure that you don't give things away by touching the ring in your pocket constantly, or saying daft things. If you're bringing her to a place she's never been before, or somewhere extra romantic, and you have a feeling that if you're there for more than thirty seconds, she'll know exactly what you're up to, then try to propose as soon as you can, so you don't lose any of the surprise factor. There may be tears, screaming, or . Don't be fazed; these are fairly standard reactions, even if she has every clue of what you're about to do. It's not real to her until it's done! If she says yes, end the proposal with a or a . And don't forget to put a ring on her finger!  If she says no, react with understanding and don't be petulant. She may need time to think and a memory of your sour face and grumpy attitude will leave a bad impression in her mind. Be a and don't be down on yourself -- you tried your best.

Marriage is a big step and you want to be sure that you're taking that step for the right reasons, because you've found someone that you honestly want to spend the rest of your life with, not because all your friends are getting married and you think you need to, as well.  If you're looking to get married because you're trying to 'save' the relationship or because you're scared of being alone, those are not reasons to get married. In fact, it's probably a good idea to let the relationship go. However, if you know for certain that marriage to this guy is what you want, then it's time to go for it and put your energy into making it happen.   ", " Talk about marriage and commitment with your guy. Popping the question should not be the first time the two of you discuss commitment and marriage. You don't necessarily have to talk about it in terms of the two of you (although, you probably should) but it is important to suss out his feelings about this very important thing, especially if you're going to be proposing to him.  Pay attention to how he talks about the future and what he says. If he talks about \"we\" and \"us\" (referring to the two of you) in future endeavors, if the two of you live together, own a pet together, have moved somewhere together, he is pretty committed to you. This does not necessarily mean that he is ready for marriage, or even wants marriage, so that is something the two of you should discuss. You can even find a way to talk about relationships in general, or bring up your concerns up in a potential, distant future type of way. For example: \"Becky just proposed to Henry in front of his entire family. I think I'd want to do a quieter proposal, don't you think?\"  ", " Make the proposal about him. When you're planning to propose to a guy you want to make sure that the proposal is about him and what he loves. If you wanted a big proposal in a fancy restaurant in front of everyone, that doesn't mean he would want that. You know your guy best, so make sure you use that knowledge.  For example, if he's really in to fishing, plan a fishing excursion with him and put a note in the tackle box that says \"will you marry me?\" Another example: if he's a big fan of a certain band, plan a proposal around a show the band is doing in your area (or go wherever the band is performing, even if it's a distance away). This doesn't mean that you should ignore yourself and your desires completely. The proposal should be something that is important and memorable to you, as well. You just have to find some sort of middle ground. For instance, you could follow the fishing date with a three-course candle-lit dinner at a lovely restaurant.  ", " Plan the proposal. Spontaneity is a great thing, but for something like a marriage proposal, you want to have enough of it planned that you can follow the plan even when you're nervous (because you will be nervous, but that's expected!). especially if you're making it a big deal, you want to have all the components figured out. You'll need to pick a specific place to pop the question, preferably somewhere that has meaning to both of you. It could be where you went on your first date, or it could be the first place you kissed. Picking a place that has meaning to you both works two ways, one, it's already special to you both and two, it provides a great segue into your proposal! Timing is everything. It's better to pick a time when he's relaxed and receptive to making or thinking about making a big change. It's less good to do it when he's stressed about work or school, or distracted by something else (like if you're both at a football game and he's paying more attention to the game than you and what you're trying to ask). You'll want to make sure that the mood is right for what you're about to do. It could be something as simple as lighting a few candles, or pouring out some nice champagne, or you could have a whole lavish dinner set-up. You'll need to consider what is important to the two of you. If you're including other people in your proposal (children, family members, friends, animals) you'll need to make sure that they know what they're supposed to be doing and when and especially that they need to keep quiet about it so they don't spoil the surprise.  "], "Popping the Question": [" Use his hobbies. Again, when you're plotting how to ask him, think about his hobbies and interests and use those as a way to make the proposal special. Not only does this show that he's important to you (since you are, after all, asking him to marry you), you're also showing that you pay attention to his interests and that you support them.  For example: if he's interested in archaeology, volunteer for an archaeological dig with him and propose on the dig (you can enlist your fellow volunteers to help). Or you could even make a treasure hunt type proposal and have him dig up the proposal in the backyard.  ", " Pop the question privately. In every rom-com ever it seems, there's a scene where one person proposes to another and it's always in front of a bunch of people, but, especially for a guy, it's best to do this part in private (unless he's specifically said that he wants to be proposed to in front of a bunch of people). This way it gives him a chance to think about the proposal without the weight of a bunch of people waiting for his decision. Once he's said yes, feel free to go announce it from the rooftops.

What you really need to do with it is tell him why you want to spend the rest of your life with him and would he want to do the same with you. You'll be nervous (because, who wouldn't?) so keeping it simple makes it easy for you to remember what you're going to say. Have a few lines to lead up. You could say something like, \"We have so many awesome memories... From now on, I want ALL my memories to have you in them.\" and propose. Or, before your day, \"I have this wonderful day planned for us, but I just can\u2019t wait... I want us to spend it together as more than just boyfriend and girlfriend\" and then propose.

You'll want to give him some sort of symbolic gift, like an engagement ring, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a ring, especially if he isn't the type to wear a ring. You know your guy best, so you'll have to decide what the gift should be, but there are lots of options.  You could get him a wrist watch or pocket watch, because these are sometimes considered the male form of jewelry anyway. You could even have it engraved with both of your names to make it more special. You could make something handmade for him, like a box containing all your favorite memories together, or a ceramic plate that asks him to marry you. If he's the type who wears necklaces, you could get him an engagement necklace, perhaps even with a ring on it. Engraved lighters are also, often, used as engagement gifts for men (or women) and can be very cool and attractive.  ", " Deal with the aftermath. As you can't control the outcome, proposing to someone can be very nerve-wracking and make you feel vulnerable. That's no reason not to do it, but you have to be prepared for every eventuality. If he says yes, great! It's time for a party. You can set the wedding date, or leave that until sometime in the future (you don't have to get married right away, just because you got engaged). If he needs time to think, that doesn't necessarily mean he's going to say no. The proposal may simply have caught him by surprise and he really does need to think about what it will mean. Let him do that. If he doesn't get back to you, talk to him about the proposal and what his concerns are. If he says no, you are going to feel upset and you have every reason to ask him what his reasons are and if will ever change his mind. It could simply be that there is too much going on at the time (school, a big move, his parents are ill) and he can't think that far ahead, or it could mean that he doesn't want to get married.

Lots of people like a good proposal that has to do with food (as long as he doesn't end up eating the proposal by accident!). There are lots of ways to use food to make a fun marriage proposal. There are ways to have personalized fortune cookies made. You could have one made that says 'Will you marry me?' and make sure it gets mixed in when you get take-out (or if you make some lovely Chinese food).

Before you decide to propose, make sure marriage is on the table. While you do not want to ruin the surprise, you need to at least make sure your boyfriend is interested in marrying. Work marriage into your conversations to get a sense of whether proposing is a good idea.  You can bring it up directly. For example, say something like, \"Do you think we'll ever get married?\" When discussing marriage, bring up the topic of a proposal. Say something like, \"Do you like the idea of a formal proposal?\" Some people prefer to get engaged together as a couple. Try checking with a close friend of your boyfriend's to see if he has ever brought up the idea of getting married.   ", " Figure out what his dream engagement is. See if he wants a surprise engagement, if he wants you to propose to him, or if he'd rather have a conversation first. You can bring this up casually well in advance of your actual proposal, so that it is something you both know about one another. You might say, \"When you imagine getting engaged, what do you picture?\" or \"Do you have any friends with really great engagement stories?\" If you don't think your boyfriend would love a traditional surprise engagement, think about ways the two of you could mark the occasion together. For instance, he may want the two of you to pick out engagement rings together.  ", " Add a twist to what your boyfriend would want. Think about what your boyfriend would want in terms of a proposal. Maybe your boyfriend has brought up the subject before. Try to honor his wishes, but provide a small twist. This will help keep the surprise and add something extra to your boyfriend's dream proposal. This can be especially nice if the proposal is not entirely a surprise. If you agreed to get engaged within a certain timeframe, for example, your boyfriend may be expecting the proposal.  For example, maybe your boyfriend always dreamed of getting engaged on a romantic vacation. Take him on a trip but do not propose on the trip. Instead, pop the question on the airplane on the way there. Maybe your boyfriend admitted he would like to be proposed to at the coffee shop where you first met. Instead of simply asking him there, surprise him by having a group of friends meet the two of you there holding a sign that says, \"Will You Marry Me?\"  ", " Pick a location. To start, think about where you want to propose. Think about what your boyfriend would want and find a place that's special and meaningful for both of you. Where is somewhere that was or is special for the two of you? You can also define your boyfriend in a couple of words to get an idea of what would suit him, such as traveler, adventurer, romantic, philosopher, etc. This can help you to narrow down your options to identify something that will be meaningful to him. Would your boyfriend want a public or private proposal? If he wants something private, think about a special place to propose without onlookers. You can propose at home and decorate your house with things like candles and photographs of the two of you. You can also go some place private together, like a secluded hiking trail where you've gone on hiking dates. If your boyfriend wouldn't mind a public proposal, think about public places you both enjoy. You could propose at the coffee shop where you had your first date. If your boyfriend dreams of a proposal in front of friends and family members, ask him to marry you at a dinner party with friends.  ", " Choose the right time. Think about important dates. You can choose a date that's significant for the two of you. For example, propose to him on his birthday or your anniversary. You can also choose a date that makes logical sense regarding future plans. For example, if you want to be engaged by his cousin's wedding in March, consider proposing some time in January or February.  Try to think of a unique date if you want something memorable. Instead of choosing your anniversary, choose another significant date. For example, propose to him on the anniversary of when you two adopted a kitten together.

Many modern proposals do not use a ring, but if you think your boyfriend would like one you can find one in his size.  If you don't want a ring, many people choose another item to symbolize the proposal. You can get him another piece of jewelry, such as a watch, or just give him a gift to mark the occasion.

Traditionally, men propose to women with rings. Many people feel men will propose when they're ready and women should wait, and that breaking this tradition is a bad thing. If you're a woman proposing to a man, you're breaking tradition slightly. Think about how much your boyfriend cares about you taking the lead. Many people worry they will be stealing their boyfriend's thunder, or pressuring him into something prematurely. If your boyfriend is truly ready to get married, and is not big on traditional gestures, it is probably okay to propose. However, if your boyfriend or his family are more traditional, bring up the issue in conversation. Ask your boyfriend how he feels about women proposing to gauge his potential reactions. You can also think about his attitude about gender roles and consider whether he is more traditional or open-minded about proposing.  ", " Think about how to adjust the custom as needed. An engagement follows a traditional narrative. The man proposes to the woman, usually with a ring. If you're in a same sex couple, or if you're a woman and proposing, you do not have as many set customs and traditions. Think about how you can alter custom to make things work for you. There is nothing wrong with getting a man a ring to propose. You can select something cut in his style and opt for the tradition down on one knee proposal with a ring.

I just happened to have a great idea for a proposal before he did.\" Prepare ahead of time for what you might say if someone says something hurtful to you.

If you're proposing at home, it's fairly easy to set the scene. You can dim the lights and light candles. You can also put up decorations, like pictures of you and your boyfriend. If you're proposing publicly, you have less control over the scene. However, there are some things you can do to get the scene you want.

For example, if you bought your boyfriend a nice watch to propose, think about having him close his eyes and then slip it on his wrist. If you're presenting a ring, think of a fun way to do it.

If this is the case, don't expect him to be as enthusiastic about marriage as you are and accept that it's something he'd be doing mostly because you want to. You'll have to do a lot of nudging to get the wedding of your dreams. It's also possible the he doesn't want to get married at all, to anyone. Getting a guy who decidedly doesn't believe in marriage to propose to you is pretty much impossible.  "], "Dropping Hints": [" Bring up marriage casually. To avoid overwhelming your boyfriend, you should start by being subtle and build your way up to talking about your own marriage. You should start by casually bringing up a conversation about marriage that doesn't directly involve marriage. You can mention someone else who got married or engaged recently or make a comment on an engagement commercial, for example. A good way to start things is to express confusion or even mild criticism. Here's how to do it: You could say, \"A co-worker just got back from his honeymoon. You know where they went? To the beach. That's so weird to me because we go to the beach about once a month and it's so close by. If I was going on a honeymoon, I'd want to go somewhere new and exotic. Wouldn't you?\" You could also say, \"Can you believe John proposed to Marla on a Ferris wheel? I think that's perfect for them, but I think I'd like something a little different.\"  ", " Mention your future together. Don't say, \"I can't wait to have ten kids with you!\" Just subtly start making comments that allude to you being together in the future, whether you're married or not. If he isn't responsive to the indirect approach, start slowly making it more direct with phrases like, \"if we stay together,\" \"if we live together,\" and later, \"if we get married.\" Watch his reaction when you discuss the future. See if he carries that conversation on or avoids the subject. Remember that even though this may have been on your mind for a long time, this is a new conversation for him and he needs time to sort out his thoughts. Don't expect him to have his answer prepared.  ", " Plan a romantic trip. If you think that your man has been waiting for the perfect time to make the right move, then suggest that it's time that you go on vacation. Make sure that you plan it far enough away -- at least two or three months -- so your man has time to think of it as a potential place to propose. Don't mention anything about how it would be the perfect proposal destination and wait for him to figure it out.  If you don't mention that it would be a great place to get engaged, then he won't feel that you're putting the pressure on. And even if he doesn't propose, seeing you in a romantic setting where many people propose will put his mind on proposing.  ", " Comment that a ring is not important to you. If you don't want an expensive ring -- or a ring at all -- mention it casually in a conversation. This is an important point. Many men don't propose because they're putting off figuring out what kind of ring their woman wants and what her ring size is. Many more men don't propose because they're not ready to shell out thousands of dollars for a diamond ring and think it'll take them forever to save up for it. Well, if you want a fancy ring, or even a ring at all, then you can mention it, however subtly, so that he knows that this shouldn't be a factor in his plans for a proposal. You can even mention your thoughts on the ring by mentioning someone else's ring. You could say, \"Did you see that rock Rick gave to Sheila? I can't believe she didn't fall over with that thing on her hand. I would never want a ring like that -- I'd want it to be small and simple.\"  ", " Describe your idea of a perfect wedding. If you don't want an expensive wedding, mention it. Though a proposal does not mean an immediate wedding, many men are also deterred from proposing because they're worried that they'll never be able to afford an expensive 400 person wedding, or because they don't want to be roped in to the wedding-planning hoopla. Well, if you planned on just having a small wedding in the park with 50 of your closest friends and family and having a casual dress code, you should find a way to mention this too. Though this shouldn't be a factor in a man's decision to marry you for life, it does deter men from wanting to get the ball rolling on the whole marriage thing. Can you blame them?  ", " Let him see you as \"wife material. \" Though he may think you're a ton of fun or a sex kitten, you should also let him see you as wife material -- as the woman who will be his lifelong partner and potentially the mother of his children. So, show him that you'd make a great wife as well as a fun girlfriend. Let him see that you're independent and career-oriented while also knowing how to take care of him when he's sick, how to tastefully decorate your home, and how to cook a healthy meal -- nothing fancy required. If you want him to see you as a wife, then your relationship should be positive most of the time. If you spend most of your time fighting or crying about your insecurities, he won't think you're ready for marriage. Let him see that you have your act together on your own and that you're ready to move towards marriage. If he thinks that your life won't be complete until you get married, he won't want to propose.  "], "Being Direct": [" Address his fears. If you've openly discussed marriage, then you can assuage his fears a bit so he sees that he has nothing to be scared about. Maybe he's concerned that once you get married, you'll change somehow, and settle into a comfort zone . Or, is he worried that after tying the knot, he'll be pressured to start a family right away? It could also be that he feels insecure somehow, and his current self-image doesn't match the role he envisioned as a husband. If he's just worried about the ring or the wedding itself, then you can think of some creative compromises. If he can't afford a ring, can you live without one? If he doesn't want a big wedding, how about eloping or having a small, private ceremony? If he's afraid that marriage will take the luster out of your relationship, have some go-to happily married couples that you both admire that you can point to.  ", " Make a logical argument for getting married. If he's a logical thinker, appeal to that part of his brain. Though it may not be the most romantic approach to take, there are some practical benefits of getting married. Practical and legal benefits of marriage include putting your significant other on your insurance plan, being eligible for more government benefits and filing joint income tax returns.  Marriage is also an effective way to make sure your mate is taken care of if you die suddenly. If you are not married, and one of you dies, the other will not inherit anything unless it is spelled out in a will. And even if it , there will be estate and gift taxes. Also, if you are married you can receive wages, workers' compensation, and retirement plan benefits for a deceased spouse. Though you may not want to go down this morbid line of thinking, it is very logical, and is something to consider -- especially if you've been together for fifteen years and aren't married.  ", " Make him see what he'll miss if he doesn't marry you. If he really sounds like he's unsure about whether he wants to marry you or not, or even says he needs some time to himself to figure some things out, then let him have that time. But make it clear that you're not waiting around forever for him to make the move, and that you're a great catch that any man would be lucky to marry.  While you shouldn't make him feel bad for being uncertain or make him propose because he feels jealous or guilty, you let him know that if you've invested a lot of time and love into the relationship and he still doesn't know what he wants, that you have your limits, too.  ", " Propose yourself . If you think that the time is right and that you're both ready to get married, then hey, it's the 21st century and you can take the matter into your own hands. If you've been waiting around long enough and you're sure that the only thing really holding your man back is the proposal itself instead of the prospect of marriage, then speed things up by asking him to marry you. "], "Knowing What Not to Do": [" Avoid repeatedly bringing up marriage talks. It's a guarantee that if you mentioned wanting to get married once, it's burned into his brain. The more you talk about it, the less he hears it. If you're the one who brings it up and the word \"marriage\" never comes out of his mouth, then you should take it easy for a while. ", " Tell your friends and family to zip it. You may think your friends are being helpful by casually slipping in marriage comments to him, but it will likely make him feel ganged up on. Let him come to the decision on his own, without the advice or urging of those in your life. ", " Do not give him an ultimatum. Though you may think that giving your man an ultimatum is the fastest way to get him to spring to action, giving an ultimatum -- \"Marry me or it's over\" -- will actually make him feel too much pressure and won't make him propose any faster. Saying, \"Propose in the next two months or it's over\" will actually scare him off and will deter him from proposing. However, if you really feel like you've been waiting around forever and are fully ready and think he is, too, then let him know without making a harsh statement.  ", " Do not put pressure on him. If you've only been with your boyfriend for a few months, or have been together longer than that but things aren't serious between you, be honest with yourself. You shouldn't start pressuring him to marry you if he's beyond not ready. Doing this too early in the relationship, especially way too early, can end the relationship quicker than you can say, \"I do.\" Just because all of your friends are getting ready or you can't wait to try on a wedding dress doesn't mean that you should talk about your wedding from your second date -- or there won't be a third.  ", " Do not be desperate. Many magazines may give you the wrong message, making you think that if you want your man to fall in love with you, all you have to do is cook a five-course meal in a pair of hot high heels, stay up late to pick him up when he's on a bender with his buddies, or to generally be at his beck and call so he can see what an \"amazing\" girlfriend you are. This will make him upgrade you to wife status. Men are much more interested in women who are confident and independent than women who serve their every need and will drop everything just to pamper and feed them -- especially if they're only doing it because they think it'll make him more likely to propose.

The idea here is that everybody involved in the scavenger hunt, with the exception of the woman you love, knows that you will propose. A team composed of at least three of your friends and assigning each team tasks will help you carry out your plan. Appoint some of your friends to accompany your soon-to-be-fianc\u00e9 and ask them to regularly inform you of their whereabouts while the scavenger hunt is ongoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how many teams you have assigned, but the more participants, the merrier the hunt should be, right? ", " Give each group a list of the things they should accomplish for the scavenger hunt. Extend your hunting grounds by making them go to unfamiliar territory. This should buy you more time to decorate the place, set up a table of champagne and strawberries, change into your best clothes or other things you need to do before she gets to her final task. Tell each group they can\u2019t move on to the next task without finishing the task before it; of course, the only group who\u2019ll be doing this strictly is the group she belongs to. Instruct them to take pictures or videos of them doing the task so they have proof. Here is an example of a scavenger hunt list: Go to the park and make a stranger tell you you\u2019re beautiful or handsome without telling them you\u2019re playing a game. At least two persons from the group should do this (2/3) to proceed to the next task. From the park, buy two hot dogs and then proceed to the nearest mall with three floors.

Go down the ground level and find someone who would be willing to accept the photos and keep them. Outside the mall, all three members of the group should ask a stranger for a quarter. Keep the quarters afterwards as you will need them. At the nearest museum, each of the members needs to ask three strangers for their names and mobile phone numbers.
