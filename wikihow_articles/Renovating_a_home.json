Take a good look at the house and read any inspection reports you receive as part of the sale. Find out whether problems with the house are structural or cosmetic. Will you need to move or repair walls, or just paint them? Are the plumbing and electrical systems modern and in good condition?  If this is a home where you have been for some time, you may want to hire a home inspector to help look for major problems before you undertake to renovate. It could keep you from having to do a job twice.   ", " Get organized. Tour your house with a clipboard or notebook and list all the changes you would like to make. Keep all your contacts, ideas, minutes of your meetings and copies of architectural drawings and prices filed together. Always ask for copies of anything, even work schedules, and keep it filed. Even if you don't read all these, it will keep everyone you deal with on their toes.  Make a pencil sketch of your ideas. It need not be architectural quality or to scale. It can also be what you have saved from the internet or collected from magazines. This is for your bases of discussion with your architect and contractor, if you have them.  ", " Decide how much you are willing to do yourself and what will need the help of a contractor. You'll probably choose to do some of each. There is generally no need to hire a contractor to install a towel rod, but you may prefer not to install your own shingles on a steep, second-story roof. ", " Plan your budget. It is likely that buying the house and necessary things to go in it will leave you low on cash for some time after you buy.  ", " Decide where you will live while you renovate. Will you be able to live in the house, or part of it, while you renovate, or will you need to live elsewhere? Could you camp in the living room while the bedroom still smells of fresh paint and carpet? ", " Plan your approach. While some parts of home remodeling and home renovation can happen at any time, some activities depend on other activities to happen first.  Identify and address anything that's urgent. Look for immediate safety hazards, such as a broken window. Also look for problems that will cause further damage if not addressed, such as a leaky roof. Know what depends on other projects. Tackle major repairs first. It doesn't make a lot of sense to paint a wall you plan to tear down. Or, start with small projects. If you're planning to do a lot of work yourself and just getting started with home repairs, smaller projects can give you experience and confidence. Small projects can also help you accomplish larger ones or make a space usable until you can do something more involved.  Smaller or interim repairs may even be all you can afford at first. Try to do related projects together. For example, if you have removed carpeting or other flooring, take the opportunity to repair squeaks, water damage, and any other flaws or damage to the sub-floor.  ", " Do a little at a time. For long projects that encompass the entire house, such as painting or replacing all the doors (or all the doorknobs), see if it makes sense to go one room or area at a time.  This approach will also help you to spread your expenses over time.  ", " Do a major project all at once.

Do some research to get a clear vision of what you want each room to look like. Spend some time browsing design magazines and websites. Tear out pictures of ideas that you like, or digitally save images that appeal to you.  Try to figure out a theme early on and stick to it. For example, think about whether you want your kitchen to be modern, traditional, or eclectic. If you admire a friend\u2019s home, ask them if they\u2019d mind telling you where they shopped or found inspiration.   ", " Figure out your budget. Home renovations can get very expensive quickly. To avoid the stress of overspending, create a detailed budget and stick to it as closely as possible. You can contact your bank about securing a home equity loan to cover the costs. Contact professionals and visit stores to get an idea of prices. You\u2019ll want to estimate costs for items like:  Appliances Flooring Lighting Plumbing Electrical work Installation costs Furniture Accessories Payment to any professionals you hire  ", " Hire an architect if you are doing major structural changes. If your renovations are simple, you might be able to handle them yourself. But if you plan on knocking down walls, adding plumbing, creating new windows, or moving a staircase, to name a few changes, you\u2019ll definitely want to work with an architect. Contact several architects to find one that you want to work with.  Before you hire an architect, make sure to ask to look at their portfolio. You want to make sure that they have experience handling projects similar to yours. You should also ask for a quote about how much their work will cost.

Hiring a designer is a great idea if you want someone else to shop for things like furniture and accessories. Meet with a few designers to find one that you feel comfortable with.

", " Find a contractor if you would like someone to manage the project. Look for a general contractor if you have a large or complex project. They will supervise all workers, get the necessary building permits, and oversee all elements of the remodel. If your project is smaller, consider a specialty contractor who works on installing items like counter tops and bathroom fixtures.  Whichever type of contractor you need, meet with a few candidates before hiring anyone. You should also ask for a projected budget and timeline. Ask family and friends for recommendations. You can also read online reviews to see if other customers had a positive experience.  ", " Weigh the pros and cons of a DIY renovation. Once you start pricing the services of professionals, you might be tempted to go the DIY route. Before you make that choice, consider several factors. For example, if you don\u2019t have the necessary skills, you might end up doing costly damage.  Also consider your timeline. It will likely take you much longer to do the job than a professional. Decide if that is a major factor in your decision. If you decide that you want to do the work yourself, make sure that you do so safely. Do not attempt to rewire your house, for instance, if you don\u2019t have that sort of experience. However, you can paint the walls in your living room yourself without any prior experience. Don't be afraid to hire a professional only for the things you really need. For example, you might hire someone to install your appliances, but choose to decorate on your own.  ", " Make a timeline and plan to stay organized. Figure out a reasonable timeline. For example, it is unreasonable to expect a full kitchen renovation in a day. It's much more likely to take at least 2 weeks. Pick a target date, but be prepared for setbacks. For example, sometimes items you purchase might be on back order.  If you hire professionals, check in with them at least once a week to check on their progress. If you are doing the work yourself, resist the urge to multitask. If you start on the bedroom before the bathroom is done, you\u2019ll end up with 2 projects, which is harder to manage than just 1 at a time.

However, keeping your current layout can save you a significant amount of money. When possible, try to leave major fixtures and appliances where they are.  For example, you might think it would be nice to have your sink on a different wall. But that would mean ripping out old plumbing and installing new pipes. Instead, ask yourself if you can live with just having a new sink installed in the old spot. Similarly, it can be very expensive to create new spaces for your range or wall oven.  ", " Choose granite counter tops for the most popular choice. Keep the resale value of your home in mind as you make renovations. Many buyers prefer granite counter tops, so if there is a chance you will sell or need home equity in the future, granite is the smart choice. You can choose from a variety of shades, from light to dark.  Make sure to price several different cuts of granite. Oftentimes, a $25 slab will look just as good as one that costs $45. Choose laminate for a more affordable option. If you have an average sized kitchen, you can expect to pay $500-$1200 to have laminate installed. Granite would cost about $3,000-$3500.  Keep in mind that they typically don\u2019t last as long as granite. Laminate likely won't last more than 10 years, while granite can last for over 100 years.  ", " Select non-name brand cabinets to stay within your budget. Cabinets can quickly become one of the most expensive parts of a remodel. Name brand cabinets cost significantly more than mid-range cabinets, but offer the same quality. What\u2019s most important is that you choose a solid wood front for the doors and drawers. Laminate particle board is cheaper, but won\u2019t hold up well.  You can expect to pay between $100-$300 per square foot for cabinets, depending on the materials you select. Make sure that the shelves are made of at least .5 inches (1.3\u00a0cm) thick furniture grade plywood. Talk to your supplier about getting a warranty for your cabinets. Many will offer one.  ", " Look at a variety of appliances to find ones that fit your space and budget. Unless you are a serious chef, you probably don\u2019t need top of the line appliances. Instead, look for mid-range products that have excellent customer reviews and warranties. You can compare models online, but it might be most helpful to go to a store so that you can get a feel for what you want. Most importantly, make sure you have enough space for what you choose. Measure both your space and appliances carefully. You should look at a range of:  Refrigerators Ovens Cooktops Microwaves Dishwashers The features you choose are really up to you. If you want to increase resale value, go for energy efficient appliances. These are typically quiet and cut down on electric bills.  ", " Add special features that will increase resale value.

Ask yourself several questions before you begin this renovation. For example, identify if you are updating to modernize the plumbing and fixtures or simply to make a style change. The former will be more expensive, so budget accordingly. Also, make sure to keep in mind what you actually need. While Jacuzzi tubs are popular, for instance, you don\u2019t need one if you don\u2019t enjoy a long soak.  If you are working with a professional, ask them for advice on what sort of fixtures are most appropriate for your space. Take into account whether you want this room to stay in the same style as the rest of the house and plan accordingly. For example, if the rest of your house is ultra modern, you probably don't want to choose a rustic look for your bathroom.  ", " Choose between custom built or more affordable store-bought accessories. If you want a luxurious bathroom that is your sanctuary, custom built fixtures might be the way to go. That way, you can have the corner soaking tub and the standalone rain shower. But if you\u2019re looking for function over style, consider getting store-bought fixtures, like a bathtub. They will be much more affordable.  Visit a store that sells fixtures and spend some time deciding what you want to focus on. For example, if you want a free-standing tub to be the focal point of your room, allocate extra money for that feature.  ", " Pick porcelain for a long lasting tile. Natural stone tiles have become very popular for bathroom floors and shower walls. However, if you choose porcelain as your material, you can save a lot of money. Also, porcelain is incredibly long lasting, so you\u2019ll be getting the best value for your money.  Many porcelain tiles are now made to mimic the look of natural stone, so you can have the best of both worlds!  ", " Install recessed lighting to brighten up the room. Bathrooms are often small, so it\u2019s important that your lighting helps highlight the space you do have. Recessed lighting throughout the ceiling can help make the room seem brighter. Try to add 1 or 2 of these fixtures in the shower, as well.  You might also want to consider some bright lighting around the mirror, which can make it easier to see any makeup you\u2019re putting on. If you can, add a window to your bathroom. This feature adds a lot of resale value.  ", " Choose a wall hung toilet for an affordable space saver. Wall mounted toilets are increasingly popular for good reason. They save a lot of space, as the tank is inside the wall. Also, the toilet is hung from the wall, leaving the floor underneath clear. This makes it a breeze to clean underneath!  Keep in mind that while the toilets are relatively affordable, installation can be expensive. You might be able to DIY if you have any knowledge of plumbing.  ", " Use small tiles for a safer shower floor. Smaller tiles (about 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) will give you more traction. Choose smaller tiles to make your shower floor more slip-proof. You can choose tiles similar to those in your bathroom floor to create a cohesive look.  ", " Maximize space by creating several storage spaces. Because bathrooms can be small, storage space is often limited. When planning your renovation, make sure to include several separate storage areas. For example, you might include a linen closet for storing extra towels.  Large medicine cabinets and under sink storage are also great ways to add storage space. Consider adding a ledge in your shower where you can store products like shampoo.  "], "Redoing a Living Space and Bedrooms": [" Select new flooring to update the space. The floor is the part of the room that is most likely to show wear and tear. Once of the best ways to refresh a room is to install new flooring. If you\u2019ve had carpet before, consider changing to hardwood or laminate floors.  If you choose carpet, make sure it reflects your lifestyle. For example, white carpet probably isn\u2019t a wise choice if you have small children or a playful puppy. Visit a flooring store to look at samples and get a feel for what materials cost. For example, laminate is less expensive than actual hardwood. You could compare the 2 to see what works for you.  ", " Paint the walls to make the room feel like new. Painting is probably the easiest way to give a room new life. For a bedroom , try to stick with cool tones such as blue. This will create a soothing environment.  Feel free to be creative in your living space. For example, you could have a gray room with 1 red wall to create a dramatic .  ", " Purchase new furniture to modernize the room. Whether you\u2019re looking for a new dining table or an updated sofa, furniture will help make your newly redone room feel like home. Spend time browsing design magazines to get a sense of what you like. If you\u2019re working with a designer, provide them with plenty of clippings before they shop.  For the kitchen, look at tables, storage racks, and bar stools. You might price couches, end tables, and lamps for your living room. For the bedroom, consider headboards, dressers, and nightstands. You might want a new table or buffet for the dining room. Your furniture should fit your lifestyle. For example, if you have a large family, consider a long dining table with a bench on 1 side to accommodate several people. If you and your partner love movie night, a comfy sofa might be your priority.  ", " Accessorize the room for an easy update. If you don\u2019t have the budget for a complete remodel, add accessories to any room for an easy update. In the living room , add new picture frames, lamps, and area rugs. You could add a new end table to your bedroom.  For your dining room, you might display decorative plates on the walls. To jazz up your table, add new place mats and napkins. Mirrors are a great way to make a small room look larger. To fill a large room, consider purchasing some oversize pieces, such as a long table or sectional sofa.

This will allow you to determine your qualifications for mortgage financing. Avoid refinancing complexities, and have legal counsel available. ", " Focus on reducing your energy costs. Most older housing offers poor insulation in the walls, attic and foundation. Confirm the International Building Code standards for your area by contacting Building Code or Inspection Department of local government. Superior windows with improved infiltration resistance, insulated glass and Solar Heat Gain Coefficients are mandatory. Older wooden or steel windows may appear charming but are costly to retain in the house envelope. Hi-efficiency heat pumps or furnaces are absolutely essential to any purposeful transformation; air conditioning may not be as essential everywhere as previously assumed. Intelligent shade tree placement, new overhangs and improved insulation will not lower the humidity discomfort but may make high humidity somewhat tolerable; air movement certainly should be encouraged with improved ceiling heights, transom windows(above the shoulder height) and proportioned openings. There are many subtle, design techniques to make homes livable and comfortable and you may need the diagnostic-design service of a professional Architect. A builder may not possess the arsenal to undertake a technological transformation of this modest but desirable older home. ", " Consider room additions. Older homes rarely had common rooms or gathering places. They were expensive, and most families tolerated intrusions of each on the other because that is what families did; there simply wasn't any other option.  Probably your older house needs this common space addition. ", " Design your kitchen for maximum storage at minimum cost. Get a sharp kitchen designer to work with you; stay within the envelope of the original Kitchen and avoid the cabinet disease by creating 1 or several storage closets and buy, use, pay for, fewer cabinets. Old appliances you may use temporarily but plan for new ones and avoid Euro-slick Willie stuff. Great food depends not on the mechanical perfection of the range ,microwave or refrigerator but on the cook's knowledge and command of the tools and ingredients at his/her disposal. Adequate counter area is essential; the materials available offer wide choices all of which are excellent. Laminated plastic tops are colorful, varied and inexpensive; quartz, limestones and granites superb and your wallet shall determine what they shall be. ", " Modernize your bathroom. Probably you will opt to install a Master Bath, especially if you are undertaking an addition. Be aware a Master Bath requires a Master Closet-both large spaces.Master Closets are rather simple and inexpensive. Use double rod hanging wherever possible and plan a bank of sweater drawers. A well planned closet will enable you to reduce dresser type furniture to some extent and by all means have the carpenter install a vertical shoe rack; keeps stuff off the floor. Think about a laundry near the Bedrooms. This is locus of most dirty linen on a daily basis. If space is not available, then plan for the laundry chute to a 1st floor or Basement location. Toilet fixtures are inexpensive; plan for new fixtures and brass or faucets,showers, traps, shutoffs and vents. There is simply no easy way to preserve old plumbing if accessible during the transformation, insulate hot and cold water lines.

Finally, start shopping around to compare the different options available to you both online and at home improvement stores.", "content": {"Choosing a Type of Tile": [" Look into ceramic wood if you like the look of hardwood floors. Hardwood floors are great, but they scratch easily and can be hard to maintain. If you like the look but don\u2019t want the hassle, choose ceramic wood\u2014it\u2019s really durable and is resistant to both moisture and scratching, which means your floors will look nice for a really long time.  You can buy ceramic wood that imitates the look of almost any kind of species of tree. Keep in mind that real wood floors have a softer, warmer feel than ceramic wood, which can feel hard and cold. However, ceramic wood floors are easier to clean than real wood floors.   ", " Choose ceramic or porcelain tile for a hardy, dense flooring option. Ceramic and porcelain are very similar, but porcelain is just a little denser and a little less porous than ceramic. If you have kids, this might be a good option as it can withstand a bit more action (and it\u2019s less likely to stain).  Porcelain does usually cost a little bit more than ceramic does, but it also usually lasts a little bit longer. Porcelain tiles come in lots of different patterns and colors, so you will have lots of options!  ", " Pick cork for a soft, quiet, moisture-resistant tile. Cork is great if you\u2019re looking for an option that\u2019ll be a little softer and warmer on your feet. Cork is also a natural insulator so it could help you save money on your heating during the cold months. It\u2019s also a great option if you want to have bold walls and furniture, as the neutral coloring won\u2019t distract from any other design elements you want to implement.  Cork is less expensive than most other types of tile, and it\u2019s environmentally friendly. You can get cork in its natural color, or choose another color option if you prefer. Cork is softer than other kinds of floors, so it is a great option for kids. Dropped dishes and toys will be less likely to break if they fall on a cork floor.  ", " Opt for bamboo floors for a sustainable and soft tile. They\u2019re easy to clean and water-resistant. However, they\u2019re not great for humid climates (constant water in the atmosphere could warp the bamboo and potentially cause it to grow mold), and they scratch more easily than other types of tile. If you have little kids or pets, this might not be the best flooring option for you.  Bamboo only takes 3 to 5 years to mature, whereas trees can take 20 years or more to mature, meaning that bamboo is more renewable and better for the environment. Opt for bamboo if you are going for a minimalist look in your home.  ", " Install mosaic tile for a patterned, textured flooring option. Mosaic might seem odd for a living room, but it can really add a lot of color, texture, and art to your living space. It\u2019s great if you want the rest of the room to be simple but still want a burst of color or design in the room. Mosaic is great if you are interested in creating a design yourself, and it lasts a long time and is easy to clean.  Mosaic is more expensive than most other tile options, and it can be really hard to install yourself. Most likely, you\u2019ll have to hire someone to put it in for you. Also, keep in mind that mosaic can be difficult to repair if a tile breaks or grout needs to be replaced, so it is best for low-traffic areas of your home.  ", " Use slate for a slip-resistant, modern-looking style. Slate is great for high-traffic areas, and all it needs to be cleaned is plain water and a mop. You can choose different colors of slate, like gray-blue, green, brown, and even burnt orange. Slate doesn\u2019t retain heat very well, though, so you might want to consider getting a rug to use in your living room, too.  Slate will cost more than most other tiles will, but it will also outlast materials like ceramic and porcelain.  ", " Select marble for an elegant, polished-looking tile for your living room. Marble is really durable and can withstand a lot of traffic. You can also find marble in almost any color you\u2019d like, which makes it a great custom choice. Marble is more absorbent than a lot of other tiles, so there is a chance that it could get stained over time.  Marble generally costs about $5 more per square foot than other types of tile. Marble can be very slippery because of how smooth it is, so it may increase the risk of people falling in your home. This is not a good option for homes with children or elderly, and you may still need to cover it with a rug to reduce the risk of slipping on it.  ", " Get terracotta tiles for a rustic, red-clay floor. Terracotta provides a really specific look that resembles the color of fired clay, so the tile ends up looking like a mix of burnt orange and red hues. It\u2019s a long-lasting material, but you do have to put a seal on it, otherwise, it is really absorbent and stains easily.  Terracotta is a budget-friendly option, costing just $3 to $7 per square foot. This is a great option if your live in a hot or humid climate since terracotta will keep heat in during cooler times of the year.  ", " Decide on terrazzo tile for a shiny, long-lasting floor. Terrazzo is made up of chips from different materials, like marble, quartz, granite, and glass. Those materials are ground up and mixed together, and then they\u2019re polished to give the terrazzo its shiny finish. The biggest concern with terrazzo is that it can be extremely slippery so it might not be the best option if you have kids or elderly family members living at home.  Terrazzo is also really expensive, sometimes costing as much as $40 per square foot.  "], "Determining Color and Style": [" Make a small room look bigger by choosing lighter-colored tiles. Ceramic and porcelain are good options for small living rooms, as are any other tiles that come in white, beige, or cream colors. Light colors make a room look more open.

Bring home samples of different colors and styles to see what looks best in your living room before making a final decision.  ", " Pick darker-colored tiles to make your room seem cozier. Dark tiles absorb light, thus making a room look smaller. If you choose to use dark tiles, like black, dark gray, forest green, or brown, choose lighter and brighter colors for the furniture, walls, and curtains so that the room doesn\u2019t become claustrophobic.  Light furniture and bright curtains would look great with a dark floor. Keep in mind that dark colors hide stains and dirt easier, but chips will be more noticeable.

Buy tiles that come with patterns on them, like flowers or geometric shapes, or alternate black and white tiles to create a checkerboard. Don\u2019t be afraid to think outside the box and use bright colors, like red, yellow, green, or even pink to personalize your living room.  Think of your floor as a canvas. You can design it however you\u2019d like! Combine dark and light tiles for contrast, or go with a pattern that you like.  ", " Use large tiles to make your living room appear more spacious. The bigger the tiles, the bigger your room will appear. Look for tiles that are 13 by 13 inches (33 by 33\u00a0cm) or larger. There will be fewer grout lines in your living room, which will make the space look more streamlined.  Larger tiles also mean less grout that you\u2019ll inevitably have to clean.

There are lots of fun ways to arrange tiles apart from the classic methods you see most often.  ", " Arrange the tiles flush against the wall to make a room look orderly. For simple and quick installation, plan on installing your tiles in a straight row from one end of the room to the other. You won\u2019t have to worry about cutting multiple tiles to fit at an angle, and the floor will look very neat and organized.  A plain floor gives you a lot of creative space to decorate with art and furniture in the living room.  ", " Choose matching grout to make a room look more cohesive. If you don\u2019t want your floor to necessarily draw a lot of attention, opt for grout that matches the tiles you choose. The similar colors will make the tiles look like they are flowing together, which in turn will make the living room look seamless.  An off-white or gray grout will tie light tiles together, drawing less attention down to the ground. Choose grout that matches the tile color for a seamless look.  ", " Decide on contrasting grout to create an eye-catching pattern. A grout that is a contrasting color to your tile will pop and stand out quickly. It\u2019s a great way to make a floor look stylized. Choose this option if you want your floor to be more of a focal point in the living room.  A dark grout with light tiles will give your tiles more contrast and create more of a pattern. Likewise, dark tile with light grout will achieve the same contrast.

Measuring your living room correctly will help you make decisions about brands and companies based on the cost per square foot.

Take into account the trim, doors, curtains, furniture, and artwork that you have in the living room. It\u2019ll still be hard to tell exactly how things will look together, but having the photos should help you trim down your options.  If you have fabric or paint swatches from when you painted or bought new furniture, take them along with you, too. Make sure to bring the pictures of the room along with you when you go shopping for tile.  ", " Get samples of different tiles to see how they look in your living room. Order samples online or visit home improvement stores in person to get samples. Most samples should be free, but some online companies might charge a small cost to cover their shipping expenses. Look at tiles from multiple companies to find a style and price that fit your needs.

", " Wet a section of the wall again to prepare it to bond with the cement. Spray the entire wall thoroughly with water from a garden hose. Then, go back to a section of the wall to work on first. Spray it once again with water. Dampen an area approximately 3\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a06\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a01.83\u00a0m) in size, or as much as you can cover with cement in about 10 minutes of work.  The wall needs to be well-soaked in order for the cement to bond to it. Always work on one part of the wall at a time to avoid any problems with the cement coating.  ", " Spread a in (0.64\u00a0cm) layer of cement on the wall. The cement needs to be applied in sections to prevent it from drying out before you\u2019re finished working. To prevent issues, start out by covering the small portion you dampened. Scoop some cement out of your mix with a trowel, hawk, or another tool, then slather it over the area with a trowel. Start at the top of the wall, spreading the concrete from left to right.  A hawk is a flat tool used to pick up and hold lots of concrete, mortar, or other material. Normally you would have to dip into the mix many times. Using a hawk reduces this, making the application process much easier. For a faster way to cover wall sections, take advantage of a concrete sprayer. Load the concrete into the sprayer, then hold it close to close to the wall to avoid spraying the areas you aren\u2019t ready to work on yet. If you need to check the cement\u2019s thickness, try using a tape measure on an open part of the wall.  ", " Repeat dampening the wall and spreading cement until you\u2019re finished. Spray another small section of the wall, completely soaking it before applying a layer of cement. Smooth out the cement before moving onto the next portion. Keep doing this until your wall is coated in a single, perfect layer of fresh cement. If you make a mistake, scrape off the cement right away with a trowel or another tool. Cement is much easier to take care of before it hardens!  ", " Mist and dry the cement for 3 days. Get a big misting bottle and fill it with water. Dampen the concrete twice a day for 3 days straight to ensure it cures correctly. After that, your wall is done and you can enjoy the strong but smooth finish the cement gives it.  Cement can be painted over by coating it with a concrete primer. Another option is to mix colored concrete pigment into your wheelbarrow of wet cement to give it some color.  "], "Adding Stucco": [" Wash the wall and remove debris to make it as flat as possible. Spray the cinder block wall with a hose to rinse off most of the debris. Look for tough stains, damaged spots, and other issues you need to address. Spend time lifting stains with soap, trisodium phosphate, and other cleaners. Also, clear debris out of damaged spots and repair them.  To repair damage, . Fill in the gaps to level out the wall as much as possible.  ", " Brush a concrete bonding agent on the wall and let it dry overnight. The bonding agent provides a surface for the first layer of stucco to adhere to. If you don\u2019t apply it, the finished wall may end up looking patchy and uneven. Use a 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm) paintbrush to go over the entire wall top to bottom. Coat the wall with a single layer of the bonding agent.  Concrete bonding agents, tools, and the ingredients you need for the stucco mix are all available online and at home improvement stores.  ", " Get a stucco mix or mix your own in a wheelbarrow. Pour store-bought stucco mix into your wheelbarrow and stir in water until it has a paste-like consistency. If you\u2019re making your own, get sand, lime, and Portland cement. Try combining 3 parts sand, 1 part lime, and 1 part cement to create a good mix that adheres well to vertical walls.  You can also mix in a concrete pigment to color the stucco if you don\u2019t plan on painting it later.  ", " Apply a in (0.64\u00a0cm) scratch coat with a trowel. If you have a concrete sprayer, use it to cover large areas quickly. Otherwise, try picking up the stucco mix with a flat tool like a hawk and then transferring it to the wall with a trowel. Add the stucco to the top of the wall, then spread it from left to right, repeating this as needed to finish the layer.  The scratch coat is like a second base for the outer layer of stucco, so don\u2019t skip it. Applying a large amount of stucco all at once is a recipe for an unappealing finish.  ", " Scratch the stucco 5 to 10 minutes after applying it. Waiting allows the scratch coat to solidify it a little bit so you don\u2019t accidentally end up scratching the wall underneath it. When you\u2019re ready, get a tool called a scarifier, which looks like a handheld rake or comb. Rake it horizontally across the entire wall to scratch lines into the stucco.  A scratch coat is a rough initial layer. You create scratch marks on it to create a base for the final layer to bond to, leading to a stronger wall covering. The scratch marks don\u2019t have to be perfectly horizontal or even. Simply drag the tool across the wall a few times. As long as you have marks along the entire wall, you can create a much stronger finish. If you don\u2019t have a scarifier available, use the edge of a trowel or another tool. Make the scratches about in (0.32\u00a0cm) deep.  ", " Dry the stucco for 2 days, misting it twice a day. Leave the stucco exposed to harden in open air. Keep it wet by spraying it with water from a misting bottle each morning and afternoon. If you let the stucco dry out before it finishes curing, it may weaken and crack. Stucco is similar to concrete and needs to be treated the same way. Always let the first layer cure before applying a second one.  ", " Apply a second layer of stucco and let it dry. Finish the wall cover by repeating the process with another in (0.64\u00a0cm) layer. This time, instead of scratching the stucco, use the trowel to create whatever finished design you want. When you\u2019re finished, mist it and dry it for at least 2 days.  For example, some designers sweep a trowel across the stucco to give it an uneven, ridged design. You could also use a scarifier to give it a scratched design or leave it flat if you wish. If you wish to use concrete pigment, don\u2019t forget to mix it in with the fresh batch of stucco. Otherwise, you can apply wall paint to the stucco after it finishes drying.  "], "Covering the Wall with Vinyl Siding": [" Measure the width of the wall and cut furring strips to match it. Use a measuring tape to figure out what length the strips need to be. Furring strips are little more than wood boards treated to be water-resistant. They are approximately 2 \u00d7\u00a04 \u00d7\u00a08\u00a0in (5.1 \u00d7\u00a010.2 \u00d7\u00a020.3\u00a0cm) in size. Cut 2 separate boards to the same width as the wall.  Look for furring strips at your local home improvement store. Some places sell pre-cut strips, but you can also ask to have treated pine boards cut to the size you need.  ", " Position the boards to the top and bottom edges of the wall. The first strip is easy to position since you situate it on the side of the wall at the very top. For the lower board, measure up about 6\u00a0in (15\u00a0cm) from the bottom edge of the wall. Make sure the boards go from one end of the wall to the other, adding additional boards as needed if yours are too short.  Consider marking the installation points with chalk first. Check the line with a level to ensure the furring boards will form a straight row when you install them. If your wall has windows, doors, and other obstructions, keep the furring strips away from them. Install separate furring strips around each of these components, basically framing them. For soffits and fascia, you can get separate pieces of vinyl designed to fit these wood components. Slide the vinyl into a top strip or J-channel and nail them as needed to hold them in place.  ", " Attach the boards with screws placed every 16\u00a0in (41\u00a0cm). Measure along each of the furring strips, marking the attachment points with a pencil as needed. Use a masonry drill bit in (0.64\u00a0cm) in diameter to create holes all the way through the wood. Then, fit in (0.64\u00a0cm) concrete screws into the holes to hold the boards in place.  Have a helper on hand to hold the boards in place while you attach them to the walls.  ", " Place vertical boards along the wall to connect the strips. Cut more furring strips to the size you used previously. Line these boards up with the edges of the wall, chalking straight guidelines as needed for the installation. Drill and screw these boards to the cinder blocks. Apply more vertical strips about every 16\u00a0in (41\u00a0cm) to create a framework for the vinyl siding.  Remember to install vertical boards around each door and window to complete the furring \u201cframe.\u201d These components need to be framed in order to waterproof them properly.  ", " Measure and cut the vinyl to fit evenly over the wall. Run a tape measure from the top edge of the upper furring strip to the bottom of the lower one. Add an extra in (1.3\u00a0cm) to your measurement to account for overlap. Then, cut the vinyl panels evenly to fit over the height of the wall. Use a circular saw with a plywood-cutting blade to trim the panels.  Remember to wear goggles, earmuffs, and a dust mask to keep yourself safe while operating a saw.  ", " Attach a vinyl starter strip below the bottom furring. The starter strip is a slotted piece of trim used to hold the vinyl to the furring board. Position it so it extends about in (0.64\u00a0cm) below the lower furring. Place in (0.64\u00a0cm) galvanized siding nails in the slots pre-cut in the starter to pin it in place.  Look for vinyl siding kits online or at your local home improvement store to get all the components you need. Alternatively, buy the parts separately to suit your wall. If you\u2019re working around doors and windows, get more vinyl starters. You need corner pieces and J-channel pieces to connect them together. They attach to the furring boards the same way the starter does.  ", " Lay vinyl panels from the bottom of the wall to the top. Position the first row of vinyl panels over the starter strip on the bottom of the wall. Work from one side of the other, pinning the panels with in (0.64\u00a0cm) galvanized siding nails placed in their pre-cut nailing slots. When you get to the end of the wall, start with the next row, allowing the new panels to overlap the first ones by 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm).  Look for labels on the nail slots in each panel. These slots are often marked with letters to help installers line up rows of panels properly. The vinyl panels are pretty thin, so don\u2019t put the nails in too tightly. Pound the nails in so they\u2019re about even with the upper lip of each panel. That way, the panels can expand and contract as the weather changes.  ", " Attach a top strip to prevent water from seeping behind the vinyl. Use a snap-lock tool to punch a hole every 16\u00a0in (41\u00a0cm) over the upper furring strip. Set a vinyl strip or J-channel over the strip. Grip the strip between tin snips to guide it onto the vinyl panels. Secure it in place with more galvanized siding nails.  These are the only nails visible in the siding. Consider adding some primer and then painting over them with water-resistant latex paint.  "], "Installing Stone Veneer": [" Clean the wall to remove debris and stains. Rinse the wall off with a hose, then sweep away remaining dust and debris with a concrete brush. Spray off stubborn stains with a pressure washer. Strip away any paint on the wall with a pressure washer as well.  Another way to remove tough stains is by attaching a wire brush to a right-angle grinder. Use the brush to scrub off the stains.  ", " Apply a concrete bonding agent to the cleaned wall. Dip a 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm) paintbrush into the liquid bonding agent and use it to coat the wall from top to bottom. Keep the layer as smooth as possible to ensure the veneer fits evenly on the wall.  You can get bonding agents, along with any other tool you need, online or at most home improvement stores.  ", " Combine a veneer mortar mix with water in a wheelbarrow. Prepare the mix according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to get it to a firm, spreadable consistency. If you don\u2019t wish to use a store-bought mix, try making your own instead out of masonry cement and sand. Using a pre-made mix is much simpler and faster, however.  Make your own mix by combining 1 part masonry cement with 3 parts masonry sand. Put an acrylic polymer in a separate container to mix with water according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Combine all of the ingredients in your wheelbarrow to finish the mortar.  ", " Coat the wall with a in (1.3\u00a0cm) layer of mortar. Try using a hawk to scoop the mortar out of the wheelbarrow and then transfer it to the wall with a trowel. Using both tools together makes the process much faster. Apply the stucco to the top of the wall and spread it from left to right with a single motion of the trowel. Continue doing this to add more mortar as needed to cover the wall and smooth out the layer until it appears uniform.  Keep the layer of mortar the same depth throughout the wall so the stone veneer fits evenly on the wall. Consider scratching the mortar with a scarifier, a metal rake, or another tool to improve the finished bonding.  ", " Arrange the stone panels on the ground in front of the wall. The panels fit together like puzzle pieces, but you have to assemble them first to ensure they go together. Spread them out face down on the ground and push the pieces as close together as possible to eliminate gaps. Create the finished pattern you want your wall to have. There isn\u2019t much extra work needed to fit the panels together. The manufacturer cuts them into shapes meant to fit together. The only exception is when you need to trim the stone to fit along the edges of your wall, which you can do with a diamond blade.  ", " Spread a in (1.3\u00a0cm) mortar layer on the stone veneer. When you\u2019re ready to begin the installation, use a trowel and other tools to coat each panel. Start with the panel you intend on positioning on the lower left corner of the wall. Spread mortar around from top to bottom and left to right into a flat, smooth layer. Do this for each panel as you install it.  Dampening the stones with a spray of water from a hose can help the mortar stick to them. If you need to cut the stone panels to fit on the wall, use a with a diamond-tipped masonry blade.  ", " Install the stones from the bottom of the wall to the top. Work from the base of the wall, starting in one of the corners. Push the stone panel firmly onto the wall until mortar begins squeezing out from underneath it. Move onto the panels that fit next to and above it, leaving a in (1.3\u00a0cm) gap between each one. Keep this gap uniform throughout the entire wall.  Try to avoid getting mortar on the stones. If you need to clean the stones, let the mortar dry, then remove it with a dry whisk brush.  ", " Fill in the gaps with grout if you wish to insulate the wall. Mix the grout in a bucket with water according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Then, use a trowel to pack it into a grout bag. Hold the nozzle close to the joints between the stones and squeeze the bag to apply the grout. Fill each joint until it\u2019s about level with the stones, then carefully smooth the grout out with a trowel as needed to complete your new wall cover.  Grout protects the stone veneer from moisture and anything that might grow inside the joints. Some people prefer the way the veneer looks without grout, but keep in mind that it may not last as long as a wall finished with grout.

Slowly move the stud finder back and forth over your drywall until it beeps or a light turns on. Mark the location of the stud with a pencil so you know where it is later on. Continue across the wall under your stairs until you\u2019ve located each of the studs.  Once you finish, the drawers will look like triangles or trapezoids since they go up to the stringer, or the angled support on your stairs. The drawers will pull straight out and have a large box for storage. If the area under your stairs doesn\u2019t have drywall, then you can skip this step. If you don\u2019t have a stud finder, then try knocking on the wall to find the stud. If you hear a hollow, echoing sound, then there isn\u2019t a stud behind the wall. If the wall makes a solid thumping noise, then there is a stud.  ", " Use a drywall saw to cut out the drywall between the studs. Poke the end of the saw through the drywall so it lines up with the edge of one of the studs. Pull the saw down along the length of the stud until you reach the bottom. Continue cutting out the entire section of drywall between the studs until you can carefully pull it out of place. Keep removing other pieces of drywall between the other studs until you have enough spaces for the number of drawers you want to install.  You may also use a reciprocating saw to cut through the drywall faster. The height of the hole you cut out depends on how tall you want the drawers to extend.

Extend the runners fully to make sure they reach out past the drywall so you can access the drawers. Use in (3.8\u00a0cm) screws to secure one of the runners to the widest side of the horizontal support. Place another runner on the board across from it so it\u2019s parallel with the first one. When you\u2019re finished, each cut-out section between the studs will have 2 drawer runners along the bottom that are perpendicular to the drywall.

Repeat the process for any other boxes and drawers you have.  ", " Cut MDF that\u2019s the same size as the opening in your wall. Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is a lightweight wood that has a smooth finish and will make the end of your drawer look clean. Get a piece of MDF that\u2019s inch (0.64\u00a0cm) thick and use your circular saw to cut it down to the size you need for each opening in your wall.  You can get MDF from your local hardware or home improvement store. The employees at the store may be able to cut the MDF to size for you. You can also use regular plywood, but the wood grain will be visible when you\u2019re finished.  ", " Attach the MDF to the front of the drawer with screws to conceal it. Line up the MDF with the box on your drawer and position it so it covers up any of the areas you cut out. Screw through the MDF every 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) to secure it to the front side of the drawer. When you\u2019re finished, the drawer will have a smooth finish and be hidden when you close it.  Ask a helper to assist you to ensure the MDF doesn\u2019t move around while you\u2019re attaching it. You can choose to the MDF if you want, or leave it unfinished for a more rustic look. Screw handles or knobs onto the MDF if you want to make them easier to pull out.

Estimate when you want your construction to be finished. You\u2019ll then need to work backwards to come up with a start date. Be prepared for many delays. For example, materials might not arrive on time or the weather might not cooperate. In particular, you can\u2019t pour concrete for the foundation if the weather is too wet.  Talk to someone who has had their home built or remodeled to get an estimate for how long it takes. Generally, a new home can be built in seven months. However, the time will depend on your location and other factors, such as the complexity of your home design.   ", " Draw up your plan. Whether you are remodeling a home or building one from scratch, you should have plans and specifications drawn up. Look online for house plans or consult with a designer or an architect.  Find an architect by asking someone who has recently built a home or by contacting a local architecture institute or society.   ", " Identify your financing sources. Chances are you\u2019ll have to borrow money from a bank or credit union. Talk to lenders to see how much you can borrow, since some might not lend you more than 80% of the cost if you act as your own contractor.  Banks will also need to see your specifications, bids, and itemized lists of costs before they finalize your loan. However, they can prequalify you using estimates.  ", " Set aside sufficient time. You can spend up to 35 hours a week for several months supervising the construction of your home. Depending on the size of the project, you might spend longer. Figure out whether you have enough time to dedicate to this task.  You might be able to split duties with your spouse or a close friend, but you\u2019ll need to have excellent communication.

You should identify what work you need done so you can find the appropriate subcontractor. The following are some of the more common types:  Excavators: fill, cut, or move earth so you can pour your foundation. Masons: build block foundations, retaining walls, walkways, and anything that involves bricks or blocks. Framers: build the shell atop the foundation using lumber, sheet materials, and trusses. Roofers: prepare the roof underlay and then install roofing material on top. Plumbers: install water heating and plumbing fixtures. Electricians: install wires hidden from view, as well as fixtures and electrical switches. Siding: install siding on the outside of the building and may also handle exterior trim.  ", " Obtain referrals. Ask someone who has had work done on their home if they would recommend their subcontractors. Write down the sub\u2019s name and number. Ask generally how much the sub charged. If you see a house being built in your neighborhood, stop in and talk to the general contractor. Explain your situation and ask for the names of the subcontractors.  You can also ask for referrals at the lumberyard or from specialty suppliers. For example, if you need a tiler, then you can ask someone who sells specialty tiles. Get at least three referrals so that you can solicit bids from many different people.  ", " Solicit bids. Give the subs a description of the project, including written specifications and drawings. Ask them to submit a bid in writing. Subcontractors should provide an itemized bid that breaks out the cost of materials and labor.  ", " Research each subcontractor\u2019s experience. You want to hire subs who can do a good job and are sufficiently experienced. Subs should talk about their experience when submitting a bid. However, if they don\u2019t, you can call them up and ask. Request three references and call them up.  Ideally, you will hire a sub who has handled multiple projects that are the same size and scope as yours. For example, if all you\u2019re building is an addition, you don\u2019t need subs who typically work on huge projects. They might not take yours as seriously.

If multiple people complain that the sub doesn\u2019t show up to work, then there might be a real problem. You can check the sub\u2019s reputation on the Better Business Bureau.  In addition, check whether they\u2019ve ever been sued. Visit the county courthouse where the sub has their principal place of business. You can search for court records, which are public documents. If the sub has been sued, pull the case file and read the complaint. Also find out how the case was resolved.  ", " Analyze the bids. You should avoid automatically hiring the subcontractor who submits the lowest bid. For example, the bid might be too low, in which case the sub might abandon the project when the money runs out.  You might not know whether a bid is too low. Talk to an experienced contractor to get a sense of what is a reasonable bid. You also have to work around people\u2019s schedules.

For example, you can\u2019t have electricity installed if you don\u2019t have the foundation poured and the walls built. You should have paid attention to availability when you hired your subs. Now you need to come up with a schedule. Don\u2019t expect subs to show up exactly when you schedule them. They are juggling other jobs, too, and might overrun on another job. Pad some time to account for unforeseen delays. However, you might still end up having to wait weeks for a sub to show.  ", " Review the work. You need to find the relevant building code and learn it by heart. When you check the work, make sure that it is built up to code.  Most subcontractors are highly skilled, so you probably won\u2019t have any problems with the quality of their work. However, subs sometimes don\u2019t pay attention to how their work affects other parts of the house. For example, a plumber might cut large notches in the floor or wall and end up collapsing them in the process.   ", " Pay promptly. You\u2019ll get subcontractors to show up if you promise to pay promptly when work is completed\u2014and then deliver. Protect your reputation. When you get a good reputation for paying promptly, subs will be more anxious to show up at your worksite. ", " Send your subcontractors appropriate tax forms. In the U.S., the IRS requires that you send a sub a 1099-MISC form if you paid them at least $600 during the year. These forms must be delivered by January 31st.

Go to any hardware or construction supply store and purchase a flat cover plate with identical screw slots. A flat cover plate is basically a flat piece of plastic or metal that is designed to cover up unnecessary outlets or jacks.

All of these items are important if you plan on cutting siding. Gloves and goggles are useful for protecting your hands and eyes from damage. The most important piece to remember is the respirator mask, which blocks harmful particles released when cutting siding.  You can get all of the items from a home improvement store. Fiber cement is similar to wood siding and is installed the same way. However, the dust released when you cut it is toxic, so always wear your respirator!   ", " Wedge the siding with shims before removing it. Start with the lowest panel you want to remove. If you want to replace all of the siding, start at the very bottom. Lift the board up by hand and slide wood shims underneath it. Wedge the panel so it is at least in (0.32\u00a0cm) away from the wall. Wood shims are small pieces of wood used in carpentry to separate 2 surfaces. You can purchase packs of them at most hardware stores If you only need to replace one piece of siding, pry the piece up just above it and hold it in place with shims. Remove the nails and pull the section of siding out.  ", " Slice the siding into pieces with a circular saw or utility knife. Set the circular saw to cut about in (1.1\u00a0cm) deep. This is the average size of wood siding panels, and cutting deeper can mean damaging the layers underneath it. Starting at the bottom of the panel, make vertical cuts up to the panel above it. These small, cut panels are easier to remove and you can easily separate damaged portions this way.  You can use the saw or knife this way to cut out broken sections of siding. You can then replace the section without damaging other panels. Another way to do this is to cut horizontally about halfway up from the panel\u2019s bottom end.  If you\u2019re replacing one piece of siding, use a reciprocating saw with a short wood blade.  ", " Pry off the siding with a pry bar. Protect the house by holding a in (0.64\u00a0cm) thick piece of plywood against the wall. Rest the pry bar on the plywood as you wedge its blade underneath the siding. Use a hammer or chisel as needed to tap the blade further under the siding. Pull the board toward you to remove it, then cut any remaining nails off with a hacksaw.  If the siding feels stuck in place, you may need to deepen the cuts. You can use a utility knife or keyhole saw to do this. If you plan on replacing all of the siding, you don\u2019t have to be as careful. You can damage the other siding panels, but take care not to damage the layers underneath them.  ", " Cut any stuck nails with a hacksaw. Slide a small, sharp hacksaw underneath the wedged panel. Carefully saw through the nails holding the piece of siding to the wall. The board should be loose now. You can test this by attempting to lift the board away from the wall by hand. To completely loosen a long piece of siding, you will need to move the shims to continue cutting stubborn nails. Alternatively, you could use a reciprocating saw with a long metal blade.  ", " Cut the new siding to length. Using a tape measure, determine how much replacement siding you need. Then, use your circular saw to cut the new siding. Make sure you wear safety gear, including goggles and a respirator mask.  Measure the overlap on any existing siding panels if you can. Try to keep each panel the same size so they all overlap each other evenly.  ", " Install new panels, starting at the bottom of the wall. Start with the lowest section of siding you wish to replace. Place it on the wall, making sure the bottom edge overlaps the panel beneath it. You will need to secure the panel in place first before hanging any panels above it. Overlap each row of panels by at least 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm).  Use a level to ensure each panel is straight. Make sure any shims you used earlier are removed from the wall. You want the panels to lay flat against it. If you replace all of the siding, you have a little more leeway. As long as you keep the overlap consistent, your siding should look fine.

Space the holes out evenly along the board. You will also want to position each hole at least in (1.3\u00a0cm) from the board\u2019s bottom edge.  Pre-drilling holes prevents damage to the panels and layers underneath them, so taking the time to do it is recommended.  ", " Use 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm) galvanized nails to secure the panel. Galvanized nails are good for rust resistance. Place a nail in each of the holes you drilled and hammer it down. Each nail passes through the bottom of the overlapping board and the top of the board underneath it.  You can also use exterior wood screws if you have a drill or screw gun.

The tool looks like a blade with a curl on the end. Push the curled end of the blade underneath the free end of the panel. You will feel the curled part hook onto the vinyl lip.  You can get a zip tool or siding removal tool for about $5 USD at a hardware store.  ", " Slide the zip tool along the panel to remove it. Pull the zip tool away from the panel and toward you. Then, move the zip tool along the panels' edge. Continue until you reach the end of the panel.  ", " Unzip the overlapping panels to free the lower panel. Like with wood and other types of siding, vinyl siding is stacked. You will need to lift up connecting panels to remove any single panel. Use the zip tool like you did before to remove anything overlapping the panel you wish to remove.  For horizontal vinyl panels, you will need to loosen the panel in the row above. For vertical panels, unlock the panel to the left or right. If you want to replace all of the siding, you can use the tool to unzip all of the panels right now.

Locate the nails, then use the pry bar to pull them out of the wall.  You can also use the claw end of a hammer to pry the nails out. You will need to do this for every panel you wish to remove. Sometimes, the nails will rip through the siding and stay in the wall. Either remove them or pound them flush with a hammer before you install new siding.

You can bring a piece of your old siding to a siding distributor. They may be able to show you where to order the proper panels. Ordering identical panels is important for keeping your siding uniform. If you cannot find identical panels, you can replace all of the siding with new panels or paint the new panels to match the old ones.  ", " Slide the replacement vinyl piece in until it locks in place. Move the piece so it is underneath the overlapping panel in the next row or column. Then, push down on both panels. The uppermost panel should latch onto the lower panel if the siding is horizontal. If it's vertical, the panel should latch onto the piece next to it.  If you are replacing multiple panels, make sure you work row by row. This will be bottom to top for horizontal panels and side to side for vertical panels.

Place a nail through a flange about every 16\u00a0in (41\u00a0cm) along the panel.  Roofing screws are usually zinc-plated, making them resistant to rust.  ", " Hammer each nail partially into the wall. The trick to vinyl is keeping the siding relatively loose to avoid weather damage. First, make sure each nail is centered in the flange slot. Then, hammer the nails down, leaving about in (0.079\u00a0cm) of space between the nail head and the vinyl.  Vinyl expands and contracts depending on the weather, so keeping it loose prevents it from cracking.  ", " Push down on the vinyl while using the zip tool to lock it in place. Slide the zip tool under the panel right above the one you replaced. Use the tool to hook the panel\u2019s bottom lip. Pull the panel down as you slide the tool along the panel\u2019s edge.

You will need a caulk gun and a tube of acrylic latex caulk. Slice off the tip of the container, then hold the caulk nozzle close to the siding as you push the plunger. Move the caulk gun at a slow, steady pace so you can fill in the outermost edges of the siding as well as any gaps between panels.  Vinyl siding usually does not need to be caulked, but if you notice any gaps, you may want to apply some caulk. Caulk seals the joints, preventing water from getting under the paneling.  ", " Take a piece of the old paneling to a paint distributor to match the color. This is useful if you still have old siding up on your wall. The new paneling won\u2019t blend in properly unless you paint it the same color as the old paneling. A paint distributor can help you figure out exactly what shade of paint you need.  If you can\u2019t find the right color of paint, you can always repaint all of the siding.  ", " Cover the paneling with a layer of primer. Choose an acrylic stain-resistant primer. Brush the primer directly over any areas you wish to color. The exact size of the brush isn\u2019t important, but bigger brushes will help you coat panels faster. Move the brush in one direction across the panels with even strokes so you can coat the panels in a smooth layer of primer.  You can paint any type of siding, including vinyl. Cut and exposed edges often benefit from a coat of primer and paint.  ", " Wait about 3 hours for the primer to dry. The primer will usually dry to the touch after about 30 minutes. However, you should wait much longer to ensure the primer dries completely. You will get a more even paint coating if you wait. Check the primer\u2019s label for the manufacturer\u2019s recommended drying time. The drying time varies and can take longer if you the weather is cool or humid.  ", " Paint the siding with acrylic paint. Choose a quality exterior paint, since this kind of paint is designed to be resistant to the weather. Apply the paint the same way you applied the primer. Use a paintbrush to spread the paint across the panels in a thin, even layer. Paint only in a single direction.  A good layer of paint makes your siding more appealing. You can refresh the paint job as needed over time, but always apply primer first.  ", " Wait 4 hours before adding another coat of paint. Give the paint plenty of time to dry. After it has dried, you can repaint the siding as needed. You may need to add a second layer of paint in order to make the coloring look deeper and more even.

For example, you might refer to yourself as \"client\" and the independent contractor as \"contractor.\"  ", " Include a specific period of time. Generally, when you hire an independent contractor you only need their services for a short period of time. The contract should state specifically when the contractual relationship begins and when it will end. Even if you intend the contract to end when the work is completed, you still want a contractual deadline by which the work must be completed. If you intend the relationship to be longer term, check your state's law or consult an to find out if there are any limitations in your state regarding the length of contracts.  ", " Describe the work to be performed. Your contract should include a section that sets out specifically what the contractor will be doing for you, including what they will be responsible for and how their performance will be evaluated. If the contractor is required to use any of their own tools or resources, include this information in your description of the job. Include any information about how the completed work will be submitted or delivered to you, if necessary.  ", " Provide payment terms. One section of your agreement should state specifically how much the contractor is being paid for their services, as well as when and how you're making payment. Include any conditions you want to place on final payment. For example, if you're hiring a contractor to remodel your kitchen, you may make your final payment to the contractor contingent on the work passing inspection. Include the method of payment. If you're paying through a third-party service that charges fees, your contract should state whether you or the contractor is responsible for paying those fees.  ", " Define the person as an independent contractor. All independent contractor agreements include legal language stating that the person is an independent contractor and not your employee. It may include a brief description of the responsibilities the contractor has as a result of this relationship.  In some cases, it may be enough simply to include a statement that says \"In providing services under this agreement, the parties agree that Contractor is an independent contractor and not an employee of Client.\" Some states may require specific language to create an independent contractor relationship. Make sure any form or template you use is designed to be legally valid in your state.  ", " Get the contract signed before work starts. Signing the contract before the independent contractor starts work for you ensures that the contract will legally govern the work performed. If the contractor starts work before signing the contract, they could later argue that they agreed to something different.  Both you and the contractor should sign the contract. After all signatures are in place, make copies of the signed contract for the contractor and your own records.  "], "Taking Care of Tax Matters": [" Use Form SS-8 to get a formal determination from the IRS. If you have any questions regarding whether the person you've hired will be classified as an independent contractor or an employee, the IRS will make a determination for you.  Simply calling the person an independent contractor may not be enough. The IRS evaluates facts in 3 general categories \u2013 behavioral control, financial control, and type of relationship \u2013 to determine whether someone is an independent contractor. Either you or the contractor can file Form SS-8 at any time. You set out facts about the relationship on the form, then the IRS evaluates those facts and decides whether the person is an independent contractor or employee. If you intend to file Form SS-8, do so as soon as possible. It can take as long as 6 months for the IRS to evaluate the form and make a determination.  ", " Have the contractor fill out Form W-9. Form W-9 is used to get the independent contractor's full legal name and tax identification number. The contractor's tax identification number may be their Social Security number or an employer identification number (EIN).  When the contractor gives their W-9 back to you, keep it in your files for at least 4 years. You may need to show it to the IRS if any questions arise with your taxes.  ", " File Form 1099-MISC if you pay the contractor more than $600. When you pay an independent contractor, you must submit an informational return to the IRS stating how much you paid them. Actually paying taxes on that income is the contractor's responsibility.  You may also complete a Form 1099 and send it to the employee, although you aren't required to do so.  ", " File any required reports with your state. Particularly if you are a small business, you may be required to file informational reports with your state's labor and tax departments if you hire independent contractors. To find out what reports are required, check with your state's tax office or your state's employment agency. States may have different rules than the IRS regarding whether a worker is classified as an independent contractor or an employee for tax or other purposes. Find out at your state's labor department, or talk to a local employment attorney.  ", " Check your state's law regarding workers' compensation coverage. In some states, you must pay for workers' compensation coverage for independent contractors. To find out for sure, contact your state's department of labor. You typically can use the department's website to find out if you're required to pay workers' compensation. There may be a list of factors to consider, or a tool you can use to quickly assess whether you need to pay for workers' compensation coverage.  "], "Choosing an Independent Contractor to Hire": [" Identify what you need from your independent contractor. Before you start looking for an independent contractor, take some time to figure out exactly what skills they'll need to complete the work you have for them.  Hiring an independent contractor can be different from for a construction job or other labor position. Your methods for evaluating their skills and experience will be different as well. For example, if you want someone to write content for your business's website, you could ask for a writing sample to evaluate. If you also want them to design your content pages, on the other hand, you might look for web design education or certifications.  ", " Ask friends or colleagues for referrals. If someone you know and trust has recently hired an independent contractor for similar reasons, ask who they used. A referral can save you a lot of time and money checking someone's background.  Find out what kind of work the independent contractor generally does, and how much your friend or colleague paid them. Ask specifically if your friend or colleague has any reservations in recommending the independent contractor, or if they had any issues. An issue that wasn't a problem for them may be a deal-breaker for you.  ", " Do a thorough background check. Even if an independent contractor has been recommended to you, check reviews of the contractor and find out all you can about their reputation in the industry. Search online to find their website. If they have a portfolio of recent projects, it can give you an idea whether they would work well for you.  If they have any licenses or certifications, check with the agency that issued the license or certification and make sure it's valid and in good standing. There are a number of websites, such as Upwork and Guru, where you can advertise work for independent contractors and freelancers. Typically independent contractors then bid on your project and you can select the one you want to use.  ", " Interview at least 3 independent contractors. Talking to several people not only helps you find the best qualified independent contractor to handle your project, it also allows you to get the work done at the right price. Have an amount in mind that you are willing to pay for the work, and allow contractors to submit bids on the project.  Ask questions about their past experience and subject matter expertise. Find out whether they've completed projects similar to yours. Get the names of previous clients with projects similar to yours who you can contact about the contractor.  ", " Discuss the project in detail. Your independent contractor should have a good idea up front of exactly what work you want them to complete, what aspects of the work they'll be responsible for, and how long the job is expected to last.  Particularly if they are working for other clients, get a good idea of how many hours a day (or week) they can devote to your project. If you need them to be available during specific hours, let them know. Be clear about your expectations for the project and your goals for completion. If they will be required to bring their own tools or resources to complete the project, let them know this up front.

Be as specific as possible so there are fewer results to your search. For example, if you search for someone's personal name, you may get hundreds of results you will have to go through. On the other hand, if you search for the contractor's license number, you should only get one result. All of this information should be readily available to you.

Contracts should always be typed - never handwritten. This protects against any ambiguities that could arise through interpretation of sloppy penmanship. If you are using a pre-made contract template, strike through any unused areas with a heavy black pen or marker.   ", " Write the introduction. This needs to include the name of the contractor, the name of the company (if those are different), and what type of business the contractor is--a corporation, an LLC, partnership, etc. Include the contractor's business name, address, phone number, employer identification number, and builder's license number if applicable. If you will be referring to the contractor as \"contractor\" throughout the body of the contract, state this in the introduction. Include the homeowner's name and information.  Contact information should be provided for the homeowner, and it should specify how the owner will be referred to throughout the contract - for example, \"owner.\"  ", " Describe in general the work to be performed. Generally explain what the project is. For example, \"install new countertops,\" or \"add and paint a deck.\" This portion of the contract needs to be specific enough to clearly explain what is being done, but not so narrow as to not cover unforeseen contingencies. ", " Include the estimated project schedule. For all projects, specify a start  and end date, along with target dates for the completion of important phases of the work. You should also explain what happens if the project goes over the time limit. You need to go into some detail about this. It doesn't make sense to have the same penalty for a rain delay as for a mistake on the contractor's part. Don't try and gain an unfair advantage with respect to delay provisions. If a court sees that your contract penalizes the contractor for something that isn't his fault--a rain delay, for instance--they are less likely to uphold the contract. If your project is so large that you can't figure out a foreseeable end date, it is almost certainly very complex, and you need to have an attorney draw up your contract.  ", " Describe the materials that will be used. This is one place where you need to be a specific as possible. Many a contractor has fallen into dispute with a homeowner because the contractor uses materials he thinks are equivalent to the original, while the homeowner disagrees. Describe the material, manufacturer, item number, and quantity of any and all materials used in the project. Lay out a procedure in the event of an inability to get certain preferred  materials. Materials and equipment will inevitably get damaged, lost, or stolen during the life of the project. If and when that happens, you need to have in writing who bears the responsibility and cost for replacing the necessary supplies.  Make sure to put in writing who bears the responsibility and cost for any damage to neighboring properties.  ", " Decide who procures licenses and permits. In most jurisdictions, you will need permits and licenses in order to undertake any moderate to large scale renovation project. Decide in advance who is responsible for procuring those licenses and permits. Make sure the contractor bears responsibility for violating building codes and zoning laws. ", " Come to an agreement about the use of the premises. Workers have to eat, park, and use the restroom. Decide in advance what can and cannot be done on the premises, including clean-up and clean-up times.  ", " Decide what is guaranteed and warrantied. Some of the most important details to address are warranties and guarantees. This boils down to deciding what will happen in the event of a minor or major failure in the contractor's work. Determine the length and extent of his liability. Pay very close attention to this section. Oftentimes, state states provide better protection than a contractor's warranty will. Be sure that the contractor isn't trying to put you as a homeowner in a worse position than you would have with no warranty at all.   ", " Lay out a procedure for amending the contract. This doesn't have to be complicated, but you should get it in writing. An agreement to put all agreements in writing is typical and usually sufficient.  ", " State the total project price. The total agreed price for the home improvement project should be clearly specified. If the project is being billed on a time-and-materials basis, then the hourly rates should be clearly noted. Any other provisions, such as a guaranteed maximum price, should also be included in this section. ", " Lay out the payment schedule. State clearly in the contract when the contractor will be paid by the homeowner. Depending on the size of the project, this may be structured as a small down payment followed by the outstanding balance at the project's end, or it may be a steady installment plan based on project progress. Small projects may stipulate that the contractor will be paid the entire sum upon completion of all work. ", " Include an area for both parties to sign and date the contract. At the end of the home improvement contract, include a provision that states that undersigning parties agree to be bound by the terms of the contract. Include space underneath this provision for both the homeowner and contractor to sign and date. "], "Watching Out For Scammers": [" Beware of the \"verbal contract. \" This is just inviting trouble. Regardless of whether your contractor is a friend or just a stranger at your door, you need to get the scope and details of the work to be done put down in writing. This keeps everyone honest and clear about what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by. Under no circumstances should you allow someone to begin work without the contract signed and agreed to by both parties.  ", " Never sign a blank contract. If there's anything worse than a \"verbal contract\" for a home improvement project, its a blank contract. The verbal contract is bad because you can say that you and the contractor agreed to x while he says you agreed to y. Since it isn't on paper, no one can tell what the real agreement was. At least you can argue about the terms of a verbal contract. The contractor can put whatever he wants to on a blank contract. Since the contract is signed by both parties, it will be assumed by the court that both parties knew what was in the contract and agreed to the same thing.  ", " Beware of out of state contractors. If the deck that your contractor just built you collapses in six months, how are you going to track him down if he's three states away? It will be a difficult proposition at best. This is one area where it pays to shop local. Pick a contractor close by, who has a stake in the community, and a reputation they will want to safeguard.  ", " Don't work with a contractor who asks for a check made out to him as an individual. This is a major red flag. You want to work with a company, and not just some guy. Your contractors need to be licensed, bonded, and insured.  This is extremely important with respect to your own liability. Say that a carpenter working at your house cuts his finger off with a table saw. If your contractor has insurance, then he should be able to pay without issue. But if your contractor is uninsured, the injured carpenter is going to try and recover compensation any way he can--by suing you, the contractor as an individual, and anyone else who might be liable.

The International Code Council Commercial and Residential Building codes are revised and updated in three year cycles , and by knowing when your home was built you will be able to see what changes have occurred in your jurisdiction's building codes after it was built. Here are some general changes you might look for:  Changes in wiring standards, such as the elimination of the use of aluminum wiring in residential construction, with the exception of service entry wiring, and the requirement for ground fault circuit interrupters near wet locations. Other substantial changes in the electrical trade have also been made. Changes in site plan requirements to decrease flooding problems and to reduce have been implemented in many jurisdictions. Wind load and snow load requirements to strengthen structural elements for homes have been developed to prevent damage in severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, blizzards, and earthquakes.  Energy efficiency improvements have been addressed, although they may not be specifically written into building codes. The use of insulated or double-insulated HVAC ductwork is required in many areas, and minimum standards for wall and ceiling insulation may apply in your area. Roofing installation and shingle wind resistance standards apply in many areas subject to high winds. Flame spread limits or nonflammable roofing may be required in areas subject to wildfires.   ", " Research the local building codes specific to your area. You should be able to find this information at your local building inspection office or zoning and building department. You can also ask experienced builders in your area. They will have a vast store of knowledge in building codes, since they are required to know the current codes, and will likely remember changes they have seen over the years.

If the builder is still in business, he or she may have records of the date of construction, and may even have contract drawings and copies of permits required at the time of construction. These will give you very specific information about the construction of your home.  Check the records at your local building department for plans, permits, inspections and so on. In some cases, the builder may no longer be in business or even alive. If the business is still around, ask the inheritors of the business if they're able to help. Alternatively, in many cases it will be possible to obtain drawings, plans and other useful materials from your local planning authority or municipality responsible for building codes and resource consents.  ", " Consider hiring a private building inspector to check your home. Many real estate transactions and home sales require these inspections, and a licensed, trained inspector should know what code requirements apply to your home. When hiring an inspector, be sure to choose someone with a lot of experience and good industry reputation. If the building inspectors are required to be registered or to belong to a professional body, be sure to ask for these indicators of assured quality. If your home was inspected as part of a purchase, reread the report, or consider having a new inspection performed if it has been many years since you moved into your home.  ", " Make your own assessment if you are capable. While it isn't practical to remove brick from a wall to observe the installation of masonry anchorages or brick ties (usually required by code), you may be able to look for hurricane clips on roof framing members in your attic, and while you are there, you can also check the depth of attic insulation, strapping of wiring cables, installation of junction box covers, and other roof/attic construction details. ", " Look in the electrical panel box to make sure circuits are labeled correctly, breakers are sized to match circuit requirements, and the like. You may want to hire an electrician to remove the dead front of the panel to inspect the wiring connections to breakers (or fuses), so the type of wire (copper vs aluminum) can be determined, the size of wires, and the existence of grounding legs for circuits. Having a qualified electrician check the state of the wiring in older houses can be very important. In some cases decades of (often illegal) incremental DIY fixes to wiring or a total lack of replacing aging wires in such homes can present a fire hazard and potential electrocution problems. An electrician will be able to tell you immediately whether or not major fixes will be needed.  ", " Look at the house windows closely. Do the frames have wind load labels, and is the glazing double or triple glazed to provide insulation and to resist impact? Are there visible fasteners to assure you they are securely installed? Other window features like coatings may be more difficult to confirm. Tempered or safety glass on the other hand must have a manufacturers designation, designating the type of glass and the safety glazing standard with which it complies.  This designation must be visible at final installation and be acid etched or otherwise applied so that it cannot be removed without being destroyed.  ", " Check the visible water lines to determine if the proper pipe materials were used. It is difficult for a layman to determine if lead solder was used to connect copper pipes, but if you see a dull, grey plastic pipe with aluminum crimped couplings, there is a good chance your house, or parts of it, were fitted with polybutylene pipe that has since been removed from use, since chlorine in the water is known to cause deterioration of the internal chemical structure of polybutylene piping and the associated acetal fittings and will cause leaks.  Since the pipe is being compromised from the inside, it is virtually impossible to know the condition of the polybutylene piping.  ", " Check your water heater to see if it is a gas-fired unit, and make sure it is vented in a metal pipe. Check the area it is located in to make sure it has sufficient ventilation, as these may cause a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.  If the gas water heater is located in a garage, make sure that the pilot flame is a minimum of 18 inches (45.7\u00a0cm) above the floor. Check the water heater to see if it is fitted with a pressure relief valve, the valve should be plumbed to the exterior of the building. Make sure that, if you are located in a seismic design category C,D,E or F (you can find this out at your local building department), the water heater is strapped at the upper 1/3 and lower 1/3 of it's vertical dimensions to resist horizontal displacement during a seismic event.

If your apartment is in need of repairs in order to bring it up to acceptable living conditions, laws generally state that it is your landlord\u2019s responsibility to take care of those repairs. Typically, leases require landlords to ensure that properties remain livable, which means things like: Meeting building codes Keeping the building clean and free from damage Keeping the building safe from intruders (all windows and doors function properly, for example) Ensuring protection from the weather (no leaks, drafts, etc.)   ", " Make a list of any unreasonable living conditions. According to typical housing laws, landlords are required to ensure that the condition of their rental properties meet basic standards. For instance, if you have leaks, mold, broken windows, or other substandard conditions in your apartment, your landlord should take care of the repairs in a reasonable amount of time, and at no cost to you. Remember that most landlords are willing to pay for necessary repairs if you inform them that they need to be done. The rental properties are investments for landlords, and they want to ensure that the properties stay in good condition and continue to provide returns. Generally, there are special laws regarding renovations necessary to remove hazardous materials such as lead and asbestos. Your landlord should disclose if any of these materials are present, and you can ask about renovations to remove them.  ", " Take pictures of areas that require repairs. Before asking for necessary renovations, take pictures of any damaged or substandard areas of your apartment. Make at least two sets of these pictures, and mail one set to your landlord, if necessary. This will provide proof of the necessary renovations, should you need it.

More than likely, your landlord will respond in kind. However, if your landlord does not respond to your request, refuses to make necessary repairs, or makes unreasonable delays in doing so, you can take further action. Depending upon the area in which you live, you may be able to:  File a complaint with a local official, such as a housing, fire, energy, or health inspector. Ask a court to hold your rent in escrow, and to order the landlord to make the repairs. Sue the landlord under any applicable laws. Consult an attorney for legal advice if you think you need to take legal action against your landlord.

You can establish good relations with your landlord by paying your rent on time, following any housing rules, and keeping your apartment in good condition. These good relations can help you convince your landlord to agree to renovations. Remind your landlord that you\u2019ve been a good tenant when asking about renovations. ", " Read your lease. Make sure you understand what kinds of renovations are allowed by your lease agreement. In most cases, landlords are not required by the terms of a lease to make cosmetic (non-necessary) renovations. If you want these done, you will have to negotiate. Cosmetic renovations include things like: Painting walls simply to change the color (and not because of damage or age) Replacing functioning lighting fixtures with new ones Removing or adding walls to change the apartment layout Replacing non-damaged countertops for stylistic reasons  ", " Have renovation requests built into your lease if at possible. If you know before moving in or signing a new lease that you would like renovations done, try to have your landlord agree to these before you sign the lease. Have the renovation requests be written into the lease or as an addendum to it. Make sure that the lease includes all the information, including when the renovations will be completed, and how they will be paid for (\u201cXYZ renovations will be completed at the landlord\u2019s expense by [insert date]\u2026\u201d).

Perhaps you can\u2019t expect them to approve a complete kitchen makeover, but you might get them to agree to new cabinets or a fresh coat of paint.  Try to convince your landlord that the upgrades would make the apartment attractive not only to you, but to future renters. For instance, a landlord might not want to replace carpeted floors with hardwood, because a future tenant might not like them. You might be more successful asking for a new or better stove, however, because this is a standard feature that could benefit from an upgrade. Remember that landlords may simply not agree to certain renovations.   ", " Offer to research renovations. You can offer to find a suitable contractor to do the renovations, and to get an estimate of the renovation costs from the contractor. Your landlord might appreciate not having to take the time to do this research, and therefore be more willing to agree to the renovations.  ", " Research tax credits, value increases, other incentives. In some cases, landlords may be able to get a tax benefit from renovating their properties. Likewise, renovations might help the value of their properties rise. Remind your landlord of these incentives, as they might help convince your landlord to agree to the renovations.

By committing to staying in the apartment longer, you let your landlord know that the renovations will be worth it.

Whether you are doing the renovations yourself, or hiring a contractor, you and your landlord need to agree on how the work will be paid for.

Choosing the right piece of land, thinking carefully about your design choices, and working closely with a developer you trust will make the process much smoother.  With proper planning and smart decisions, you\u2019ll be able to build your dream house, and, hopefully, you can do so without breaking the bank. However, keep in mind that many people do go over budget when building their dream home.", "content": {"Choosing the Land": [" Research the land you intend to build your home on. Talk to your local Land Records or County Surveyor in order to find out more about the land you want to build on.  Ensure the land is free of liens and other financial encumbrances.  Choose a reputable Realtor or land developer who can help you find out more about the land you\u2019re interested in and find a parcel that meets your specifications. Try checking out county websites to find out the value of the land. This can be very useful when you are considering your options. Look into zoning laws and flood zones.   ", " Invest in problematic lots cautiously. Some people encourage investment in \u201cproblem lots\u201d such as hills or lots located on in-fill.  Because these lots are undesirable and have likely never been developed before, they generally go for a lower price than a lot that is in close proximity with infrastructure and other homes. Talk to your Realtor about purchasing a problematic lot in your area. While they might be cheaper to obtain, these lots can cost you more in development costs later.  For instance, if you have a rocky piece of land, you\u2019ll need to blast or clear away the rock in order to set a foundation.  If the land has a lot of trees on it, you\u2019ll need to clear them, too.  If the land is too far from local infrastructure, you might need to pay a lot to connect your home to sewer, gas, and electrical lines.  ", " Split the cost of a large lot with someone else. If you find the perfect piece of land to build your house on, but the official lot is slightly too big for you, you could try to convince a friend or family member or someone else to be your neighbor.  This way, you\u2019ll be able to save money by buying a larger lot and splitting it in half (or partitioning it into fractions that you both find agreeable), then having your friend or family member pay you for the portion of land that they opted to live on. Make sure that you read through the home owners association CC&Rs and the local zoning laws regarding subdividing. There may be a minimum size or a rule against subdividing. Look into whether or not this is an option for you. You may also want to request that a contingency that addresses your intention be included along with the offer. Also, make sure that you look into what you can legally build on the property. Sometimes you will not be allowed to build certain structures or keep certain types of vehicles on the property, such as boats and RVs.  "], "Choosing Your Design": [" Choose a stock plan. If you choose a stock plan -- a home that is laid out according to frequently-used blueprints -- the contractor will know exactly how long it takes to build, what materials are needed, and what the dimensions are.  If you choose to have a custom home built, the contractor will be building a home with dimensions and specifications that they have never tried before.  It is possible, in such an instance, that the actual costs will exceed the original estimate. Stock plans are customizable, too, within certain limits.  Talk to your contractor or construction company about special modifications you might be able to incorporate into your stock plan home.  ", " Build vertically, not horizontally. If you have a 3,000 square foot house spread across a single story, you\u2019ll have a larger roof and a wider foundation than if you chose to build a house with two 1,500 square foot stories.  Multistory houses have lower roofing and foundation costs than houses of similar square footage that is spread out over a large, single lot. However, keep the height of your home less than 32 feet. Building your home taller than 32 feet -- excluding the basement -- can put pressure on the limits of your home\u2019s architecture, and will require special roof trusses.  If you want a larger home, build it wider, not taller. Keep in mind that in some cases, building up may be your only option.  ", " Choose a low-cost look. If you adopt a rustic aesthetic for your home, you\u2019ll be able to leave walls of simple wood unfinished, and could even leave roof beams exposed.  A modern, industrial look could also work to keep your costs low if you, for instance, chose bare concrete floors.  Both styles would save on construction and materials costs.  Avoid investing in high-end finishes, expensive millwork, and fancy decorative components. Reject landscaping requests. Just before completion, the builder may offer to do the landscaping for you. They will usually charge far more than it would cost for you to do it yourself. Keep in mind that you should negotiate any extras with the builder when you are developing the contract. For example, if you want to have landscaping done at the same time the house is built, then you would need to include this in the contract. In some cases, the builder may be willing to landscape the yard at no charge.  ", " Build a smaller house. Think carefully about your needs when building your house.  If you build a massive house but only spend time in two or three rooms, you\u2019ve wasted a lot of square footage and money. Meet your needs, but don\u2019t add space that you might not use. Visit a display home to get an idea of the house you want and what you can afford.  ", " Build a house on par with those around it. If you build a McMansion \u2013 a large, gaudy home based on a stock model -- in a working-class neighborhood, you\u2019ll end up taking a financial hit when you decide to sell.  House prices are determined primarily by the prices of other nearby homes, not by the amount of money you put into it during construction.  Look at the other homes in your area and ask your Realtor what they\u2019re worth.  Don\u2019t spend more than the average cost of a house in your neighborhood. A Realtor may be able to provide you with much more information than you can find on your own, such as the average cost of homes in the neighborhood per square foot, the average selling price, and how many days homes in the area have been on the market.  "], "Selecting Your Materials": [" Buy low-maintenance materials. Metal roofing and vinyl siding, for instance, don\u2019t require repainting or replacing.  Though they will bring up the initial investment in building your home, they\u2019ll save you money over the long term.  Make sure to consider the climate when purchasing your building materials. Some materials may not hold up well in all regions. For example, vinyl siding may crack and deteriorate in a desert climate. Consider the CC & Rs of your home owners association as well to see if there are restrictions on the types of materials that you may use.  ", " Use reclaimed and secondhand materials. Selecting functioning but discarded materials and appliances can save you money when building your home.  Bricks, cinder blocks, paint, and a variety of appliances are available at a discount if you know where to look.  Check your local newspaper for demolition sales, and search online for home supply stores that are having sales on returns, reconditioned items, or floor models.  Online marketplaces like Craigslist also offer many secondhand or surplus housing materials for next to nothing. Not only is reusing materials economical, it also prevents waste from accumulating in the junkyard. Keep in mind that you may also be able to negotiate with the builder to have things like appliances included.  ", " Shop around when purchasing materials. Both building materials (such as nails, boards, and concrete) and finish materials (like flooring, cabinets, and doors) can be obtained at cheaper rates when you compare prices at several different home supply stores. Additionally, look for more economical alternatives to the materials you\u2019ve selected.  For instance, marble floors will be more expensive than hardwood floors.  Choose materials that are inexpensive to save money. Many builders will donate materials that they cannot use to Habitat for Humanity. Check to see if there is a Habitat for Humanity store near you where you can purchase discount materials.  ", " Identify which types of upgrades are likely to give you the most value in return. Some upgrades will help you save money, while others merely look nice. For instance, investing in quality insulation is a material choice that can increase your home\u2019s value and keep your energy costs low.  A really expensive kitchen cabinet, on the other hand, will only beautify your home, but add little in real value. ", " Don\u2019t waste materials. Building materials usually come in standard sizes.  For instance, drywall is available in 4\u2019 by 8\u2018 sheets.  If you want to put up drywall on wall that measures 8\u20192\u2019\u2019 by  4\u20193\u2019\u2019, you\u2019ll end up with lots of wasted building material in the end, plus added costs due to the time that cutting and measuring the materials require.  Set the dimensions of your home to correspond to standard building material lengths and measures. "], "Working With Your Builder": [" Solicit multiple bids. After selecting your specifications, don\u2019t submit them to just one construction company.  Research several local contractors and determine if their estimates are usually accurate or if they finish projects with overages.  Ask the companies you\u2019re thinking of working with for references and check for reviews of their services online.  Send your design specifications to reputable contractors and choose the one that sends you back the lowest estimate. Look into each contractor\u2019s availability as well. They may be scheduling their work as much as six months out. Be sure to choose a company with a reputation for finishing their work within the allotted time.  Only a certified general contractor should build your home. Make sure to ask to see the contractor\u2019s certificate of liability insurance and also verify with their insurance company that they are insured.  You can also request that the insurance company include you as a certificate holder. This will ensure that you will be notified if there is a lapse in policy.  ", " Do it yourself. If you have the know-how and the time, you can save a lot of money by building your home yourself.  Act as your own general contractor and you could save five to ten percent on the costs of building your home.  ", " Work for your construction company. Many contractors have barter systems in place where people can work on the house they\u2019re having built in exchange for a slightly reduced rate.  If you feel comfortable swinging a hammer, painting the exterior or interior, or doing some basic landscaping, you could propose the idea to your construction company.  You might ask, for instance, \u201cWould it be possible for me to contribute to the home-building process in exchange for a reduced contract cost?\u201d You don\u2019t need to build the whole house yourself.  You could choose to just take on particular tasks you know you can handle, such as the painting or lighting installation.  Don\u2019t take on tasks you don\u2019t feel adequate to tackle.  ", " Think about how your design will impact the home\u2019s cost. Plan ahead by talking with your developer or construction contractor about alternatives that still satisfy your needs and priorities, but don\u2019t make as big a dent in your pocketbook. For instance, grouping your appliances in a central location will make it easier for the developer to install the right wiring and connections for the home. Look into your options for energy sources. For example, you might want to look into alternative energy sources and consider how much these sources of energy might cost or save you over time.  ", " Insist on sticking to the budget. When you change the work order, you\u2019ll add both time and money to the homebuilding process as the new materials are obtained.  Once you\u2019ve developed a plan to build your house and received an estimate, you should stick to it.  In addition, carefully monitor the progress of the home\u2019s construction.  The contractor may realize that the costs will exceed the estimate in some necessary, unavoidable way.  "], "Saving Money in the Long Term": [" Choose energy-efficient appliances. When you\u2019re shopping for the right washing machine, dryer, oven, and fridge, look for appliances with the Energy Star logo.  This indicates that the appliances have been certified as energy-efficient by the Department of Energy and Department of Environmental Protection.  Energy Star appliances can make a home 15%-30% more efficient than a home that does not employ Energy Star certified appliances. This savings can save you on electrical and gas bills over the course of the home\u2019s life. ", " Orient your house in an energy-efficient way. Build your house in such a way that large windows covered slightly by a small overhang face the south.  This way, the sun\u2019s heat will naturally warm the home during the winter, and the house will stay cool during the summer when the sun sits higher in the sky. ", " Choose a shorter mortgage period. If you choose to finance your home with, say, a 15 \u2013year mortgage instead of a 30-year mortgage, you\u2019ll build equity faster.  Plus, your interest will accrue for a longer period. Equity is the value you get when you subtract what you still owe on the mortgage from its market value.  On a long mortgage period, the amount you owe will remain higher for longer, thus reducing your equity.  ", " Make advance payments. Instead of paying the minimum monthly payment on your house, pay ahead on the mortgage to save money over the long term.  If you\u2019re paying ahead on your mortgage, you\u2019ll end up with a lower amount of total interest and build equity faster.  There are several ways to pay ahead:  Add an extra dollar amount with each payment.  For instance, if your minimum payment is $500 each month, pay $600 each month instead. Make thirteen, rather than twelve, payments each year.  For example, make two payments each January. Use extra income \u2013 a bonus or inheritance \u2013 to pay forward on your mortgage. Make sure that you can put down 20% as a down payment. Otherwise, you will have to pay for mortgage insurance.

Nothing will give you a better return on your investment than a little elbow grease. A cleaner house will look more appealing to your realtor when he or she helps you set a price, as well as to the appraiser the bank sends out when you have an offer. Here are some ideas:  ", " Get rid of clutter. Make your house look more spacious by eliminating junky or unnecessary items. Get rid of battered furniture, decaying knick-knacks and piles of paper - or, if you can't stand to part with anything, throw your stuff in a storage unit until after the house sells. Remember that it's better to show a somewhat barren house than one that's filled to the brim with clutter. ", " Do a deep clean. Once you have more room to work, undertake a thorough housecleaning. Not only should you do usual chores such as mopping or dusting, but focus on rarely-cleaned areas such as baseboards, grout and heating vents. Steam clean your carpets, and wash walls and windows. Wipe down the blinds, and remove any broken screens. Pressure-wash any siding on the outside of your house, as well as the sidewalks and driveways. If you don't have the time to undertake such a project, consider hiring a professional cleaning service. Many of them specialize in residential properties for lease or for sale. ", " Eliminate odors. A common saying among realtors is, \"If you can smell it, you can't sell it.\" Sometimes, people can't detect how their house smells because their noses are so accustomed to it. If you think your home smells fabulous, have a trusted friend confirm or deny this as soon as they walk in the door. If you keep pets, thoroughly shampoo carpets and furniture, and wash all bedding - you're not selling the bedding or the furniture, but they're capable of smelling up the house just the same. If you smoke, do everything you would for pets in addition to washing (and possibly painting over) the walls and ceiling as well as you can. When you know your realtor will be showing the house, try to make it smell good by baking something delicious beforehand (which you can put on the counter for your guests) or lighting a candle. If you don't have candles or time to bake, pour a few drops of vanilla on an empty cookie sheet and put it in the oven at 200-250F. It will make your house smell like warm cookies.  "], "Easy Do-it-yourself Projects": [" Spruce up the yard. Get rid of trash and yard waste. Keep your lawn in good condition and mow it. Trim the hedges, get rid of weeds, and mulch the flower beds. If you don't have much to work with, plant some flowers or buy small shrubs. Anything more than that is a waste of money. ", " Add a fresh coat of interior paint. Painting your walls can instantly brighten up your house and make it appear well cared for. First, patch up any holes, no matter how small. To get a silky smooth finish, apply a coat of primer. After the primer dries, lightly sand it with a fine grit sandpaper (220 grit). Apply the first coat of latex paint, and then lightly sand that layer also. Wipe the walls down with a damp cloth after each sanding session. Then, apply the final coat of latex paint. Favor white ceilings and off-white or beige walls with white baseboards. Not only will these colors throw more light around the room and make it appear larger, they're easy for potential buyers to imagine over. Choose an appropriate finish. Semi-gloss paint will make your walls seem brighter. If your walls have imperfections, such as dents in the drywall or cracks in the plaster, use eggshell finish paint to hide those imperfections. It is a low-lustre finish that can be lightly washed. Upgrade the interior walls to a level 5 finish in order to give your rooms a \"luxury\" appearance.  Simply use 60 grit sandpaper to lightly score the surface of the walls.  Add two coats of joint treatment (USG Total or All Purpose works great), one after the other.  On the second coat, sand lightly with 220 grit sandpaper.  This will give you a level 5 finish over any textured wall.  ", " Put up fresh curtains and blinds. Blinds and curtains are relatively inexpensive. Over time, the sun fades the colors from your blinds and curtains, so new ones will make a better impression than old ones. ", " Install modern light switches and outlet covers. Some modern switches can be easily installed using the wires already running to the old switches. Just be sure to turn off the power to the room or entire house before doing any work. New outlet covers look nice, and give the impression that the electrical wiring in the house is newer than it really is.  Dimmer switches are especially desirable. Beware: It can be illegal to replace the outlets with the three-prong type while the wiring is for two prong (not grounded). This could lead to trouble if the buyer's home inspector catches on.  ", " Up the wattage. In the main areas of the house, such as the living or dining room, swap out your lightbulbs for ones with slightly higher wattage. Just make sure you don't exceed the maximum specification for lamps and other lights. (You could use compact fluorescent light bulbs in order to make the room brighter without getting new fixtures, plus they save electricity, meaning they save you money.) ", " Check the square footage. Sometimes your home's square footage will be higher than what your county assessor has recorded. Because homes sell for hundreds of dollars per square foot, even a small increase will allow you to list your home for more money. If you have a tape measure and some graph paper, you can verify the square footage of your home by yourself. Measure the around the entire house, noting any abutments and including the porch and garage. Use one square of graph paper per foot. Then, divide the perimeter into smaller rectangles and triangles - for instance, a bay window might look like a rectangle with two acute triangles on each side. Measure the area of each piece, and add it up to get the square footage of your house. You can also hire a residential appraiser to evaluate the square footage - the service could pay for itself if it was measured incorrectly before.

Obtaining a building permit can be complicated, however, if you follow the steps noted below and keep calm, the process can be managed without much to-do. In order to keep stress at a minimum, be sure to include the permit fees and the design fees in your budget as these fees maybe substantial. Many of the steps described below can be managed by licensed architects and engineers, or a licensed Building Contractors as part of their work. Use and rely on them to make your life easier!  ", " Check the website of your town or city. Almost every city has a detailed description of what work requires a permit, the permitting process, a list of documents required for the permit application and the fees for that permit.  Even with a very good description of the process and the list of documents, it is advisable to contact the local building department.  Have someone there talk you through the process.  Also ask them about the amount of time required for the review process. This opens a positive relationship with the Building Department that will help if any problems develop in the future.  ", " Seek the approval of your local Homeowner's Association (optional). If you are a member of a Homeowner's Association it is likely you will also need approval of that Association to proceed with any work.  Be forewarned that most Homeowner Associations have design review clauses that cover every aspect of the exterior of the house, including paint color. ", " Know that any changes to the structure of the building will require the services of a California licensed civil or structural engineer. This includes removal of support walls within the building or new openings on the exterior walls of the building. In almost all cases, basic cosmetic work does require a permit or city approval beforehand. Replacing old faucets or countertops in your bathroom, for example, can be managed without a building permit.   ", " Comply with the current California Building Code (CBC). Each town or city may modify this code, but their modifications must be more restrictive than the CBC.  If you are working within an older building you may need to update the entire system within the building.  For example, within buildings more than 75 years old you may find an electrical system that is now regarded as dangerous.  A renovation of part of that building may trigger a requirement to update the entire electrical system.  ", " Know your options for homes designed as historic by your city. Homes which are designated as \"historic\" are usually either 50 years old or have a special function or backstory. Homeowners of historic buildings can routinely expect longer delays in the processing of their building permit requests. As with \"normal\" houses, owners who are simply making an electrical, water heater, or other cosmetic fix may not need to obtain a building permit for their renovations. It's best, however, to check with the city beforehand. \"Historic integrity\" may need to be maintained with homes in designated historic preservation districts. This means that it needs to look reasonably like what it looked like originally. If you plan on adding roofing, windows, siding, or exterior remodel or a historic house, consult with the city about what's expected.  ", " Follow the submittal requirements to the letter. The first thing any plan checker will do is review the submittal for completeness.  An incomplete submittal will only delay your project.  If you are not able to obtain some of the documents required, check with the Building Department to see if they have them in their files.  If not, you will need to have them prepared by licensed professionals.  Many older buildings do not have surveys, site plans, or even building documents on file or available to the owner.

A positive interaction with the Building officials will help you get the review completed as quickly as possible and help you get past any problems that develop in the review process.

Do not proceed to cover up work that is to have been inspected or you will find yourself removing all of that work to expose the work that was to be inspected.  All deviations from the approved documents must be reported to the Building Department.  The deviation must be approved by them and there is likely to be an extra fee for them to review that work.

Taking the time and money to make home improvements and clean your house can quickly increase the value of your home and make it easier to sell.", "content": {"Improving the Interior": [" Apply a fresh coat of paint. Time and time again realtors stress that a fresh coat of paint is the easiest way to increase the value of your home. That said, a bright purple room may be off-putting to potential buyers. Go for neutral tones like beige or muted green with simple white baseboards to appeal to a wide range of buyers.  If you are on a budget then paint the most commonly used rooms first, like the kitchen, living room, and main bathroom. Avoid both bright colors like pink or yellow and dark shades like navy or chocolate brown, as these are polarizing choices for certain buyers.   ", " Remove any wallpaper and replace it with paint. Wallpaper is a big turn-off for potential buyers because it is a hassle to remove if they don\u2019t like it. Stick to neutral paint colors to get the maximum value for your house.  Some wallpaper, especially in small rooms, can be effective if chosen correctly. Stick to calm, simple patterns over big and bold images.  ", " Let in the light. A 2007 HomeGain survey found that lighting was the number one thing potential buyers used to separate good homes from great ones. You can add attractive lighting in a variety of ways: Install mood-enhancing dimmer switches. Put in a skylight or sun tubes (glass holes in the roof that allow in sunlight) to bring light in naturally. Remove large and stuffy curtains. Replace old light bulbs with energy-efficient LEDs for a clean, modern look without breaking the bank.  ", " Invest in new appliances. A new oven, washing machine, or fridge tells a buyer that the home is up-to-date. Old appliances, however, can signal that your home is in need of costly repairs or improvements, lowering value. Buy one new appliance if you can\u2019t afford multiple. Having one shiny, high-end appliance like a dishwasher gives the impression that all of your appliances are high end. However, a new stainless steel oven will look odd if the rest of the appliances nearby in are worn, retro styles.  If you are on a budget, look up new \"faces\" for your appliances. Often the front plate of an oven or dishwasher can be removed and replaced with a new one if you call your manufacturer and ask for a replacement.   ", " Replace scuffed, marked, or stained floors. Old carpets, scratched wood floors, and dirty tiles can all cause your house\u2019s value to plummet when it goes on the market. Rip up the old flooring and add tile, clean wood floors, or a new carpet. Spending $1,000 on a new floor increase your home value by $2,000.  Start in \"high-value\" rooms like the kitchen or the living room if you want new floors. These are the first rooms many buyers notice. Get tile for small, frequently dirty floors (bathroom/kitchen), hardwood for the living or dining spaces, and carpet or wood for bedrooms.  Recent trends have shied away from carpets, as most consumers now prefer hardwood floors.   ", " Pay attention to the little things. Even the smallest, cheapest fixes can make your home sparkle and sell for more. Switch out the shower curtain for a clean glass shower door. The more question marks you eliminate for potential buyers the more likely you are to sell your house for the right price. Some quick fixes include: New rug for the entryway. New lighting fixtures. New faucets and handles. Clean and re-grout tiles in the kitchen and bathroom.   ", " Walk through your home with a real estate agent.

Nothing can turn away a potential buyer like the knowledge that they will have to sink $2,000 into new plumbing when they move in. Address the basics of your house, (drafty windows, leaks, rusty rain gutters, etc.) or any expensive renovations you make will go unnoticed.  ", " Spend money on your kitchen before any other room. The kitchen is the most important room in the house when it comes to home value. This is the room most buyers focus on, and you can expect to get up to 85% of your remodeling costs back when the house sells. A fresh coat of paint that hides splash marks can cheaply update a kitchen. Find or buy a place to tuck away your dishes and cookbooks to make your kitchen look clean and spacious  ", " Install matching cabinets and countertops. This is a very high-value fix, especially if done with updated appliances. Begin in the kitchen before updating the bathroom or bedrooms. New cabinets can completely transform a room for the better, giving the appearance that the whole room had a makeover. For a cheaper fix, hire a resurfacing company to clean and stain your old cabinets, making them look like they just came from the hardware store.  Marble or granite counters are expensive but tend to last longer, remaining beautiful with age.  ", " Knock out walls or remove large fixtures to make your house more open. The number of square feet in your house is a major indicator of your home\u2019s worth. But you can create the illusion of more space by eliminating clutter as well. Homeowners like big, wide-open floor plans because they can imagine how their own stuff will fill the house when they move in.  Knock down inessential walls. Remove the island in the middle of the kitchen to open up the house. Install swinging French doors to allow airflow between rooms like the kitchen and dining room.  ", " Know that only insulated closed rooms add to your square footage. Adding a screen-in porch is an expensive undertaking, but it might not actually help your house\u2019s value in the long run because it cannot be counted as part of your square footage. Finishing the basement, however, can reap rewards when it is time for resale. If you have the money, consider adding additional rooms to your house. Larger houses, without fail, sell for more money. Additions, however, are expensive to construct and may take several months to complete. In general, improving your current house will lead to a greater return on your investment than adding new sections.   "], "Improving the Exterior": [" Install energy-efficient windows. Modern windows make your house look beautiful and provide insulation to save on heating and cooling costs. New double-pane windows are pricey to purchase ($75-$100), but they save you money in the long run and will significantly increase the value of the home by making it more energy efficient.

Focus on your entryway to intrigue buyers before they even walk into the house.  ", " Consider solar panels. Green technology is in, and energy efficient houses have a big leg up in the marketplace. Solar panels make your house seem modern and cutting-edge, and signal to potential buyers that they will save money after they\u2019ve bought the house. Solar panels can lead to tax breaks for homeowners, which will quickly increase the value of your house. On the other hand, solar panels might be a big concern for the buyer. If you're paying high lease rates to a third party, when the panels break, who will fix them? Also, the cheap imported panels are being leased for 20 years, but they sometimes only last for five to eight years.  ", " Update your siding. New vinyl siding is one of the top ways to increase the value of your house, and you can usually make back all of the costs during a sale. Not only does new siding usually give your house a facelift, but it usually helps with insulation and heating costs. Upscale siding, like fiber-cement boards of PVC lumber, can actually make you money on a sale, often returning 3-5% profit.   ", " Consider upgrading the brickwork. Over the years, lime mortar used in brick houses will start crumbling and degrading due to reaction with salt in the air. Eventually cracks will appear and the brick walls will become loose. The process of fixing the old mortar and restoring the brick walls to their original condition is called repointing. It involves removing the old mortar and replacing it with new mortar. Done right, brick pointing will ensure a home\u2019s integrity for at least 40 years. Brick repointing enhances the visual attractiveness of the house and it will increase the likelihood of more people liking the property which in turn will create competition on price. Having a visually attractive house to sell will roughly increase the price with 2-5%.  "], "Landscaping": [" Add shrubs or flowers along the edges of your house. Start near the front door and add small plants around the edges of your house to make it open and inviting. This only costs a few hundred dollars, but an attractive lawn brings in more buyers and drives the value of your home up before anyone even steps through the front door. Trim or replace overgrown shrubbery if it's already planted. Use bright, colorful flowers like Hibiscus, Brown-Eyed Susans, Azaleas, or Zinnias.   ", " Clean up the path to the front door. You want to make anyone walking into the house feel like royalty on the way in. Some simple ideas to make your walkway the red-carpet of house sales include: Plant flowers along the walkway. Install small lamps along the concrete. You can buy self-powered solar lights at most hardware stores that are made to be placed outside.   ", " Install a new mailbox. The box at the end of your driveway might be an afterthought during remodeling, but it can be the first thing anyone sees. If it is dilapidated, rusty, or falling down then people will assume the same about your house. You can easily buy and install your new mailbox by yourself and make it sparkle for a few dollars. Stain the wooden post so that it does not rot. Plant small flowers, like Marigolds, around the base of the mailbox.  ", " Work on a healthy lawn. This can be difficult in some climates, but healthy grass is green, devoid of weeds and covers the entire lawn. Use \"Weed & Feeds\" which are specially formulated products that fertilize grass and kills weeds, to get rid of small patches of weeds and water your grass at least 1-2 a week.  If your lawn has large bare patches, consider getting your lawn professionally seeded or installing sod (already grown grass) to make your lawn pop.  ", " Keep your landscaping simple. Avoid going overboard, like adding a soccer field or an enormous, lush garden, which can signal to buyers that your house is \u201chigh-maintenance.\u201d More important than a dazzling garden or water fountain is a clean, inviting lawn. Cut your grass regularly so that it is trim and clean looking. Pull up any weeds the flower beds. Use a weed whacker to trim away tall grass next to the house, driveway, and walkways.  "], "Preparing to Sell your House": [" Don\u2019t put the house on the market until you are ready. The first 2 week on the market is when a house generates buzz and interest. If you are still fixing the roof or painting the walls when the first buyers show up you are losing your best chance to sell the house. Wait to put your house on the market until it is clean and updated. ", " Clean your house until it sparkles. This is the easiest way to increase the chance your house sells for the amount you deserve. The cleanliness of a house is the first thing a potential buyer will notice, and it won\u2019t matter how great your countertops look if they are covered in crumbs. If you are low on time, hire a cleaning service the day before you show the house to make sure everything is sparkling. Dust the surfaces. Clean the floors and remove any stains. Wipe down the refrigerator, oven, and countertops in the kitchen. Clean out toilets, showers, and baths. Empty your closet partially \u2013 all buyers love seeing how much storage space they might have.   ", " Remember to clean the outside of the house as well. You should take the same care to clean the outside of your home as the inside. Keep your grass trim and clean up the gardens and flowerbeds regularly to make a good impression as buyers enter the driveway. Take the time to wipe down the outsides of the windows. If the sides of your house are dirty, rent a pressure washer to blast away grime from the siding.  ", " Remove traces of pets. Pets, pet toys, litterboxes, and hair all give a house the illusion of dirtiness, which can significantly lower the value of your home. Clean up your pet\u2019s mess and put all pet supplies out of sight as you show your home to make the best impression.  ", " Don\u2019t make large renovations before selling. Unfortunately, adding a new bedroom and bath to the back side of your house won\u2019t increase the value enough to pay back what you\u2019ve spent. Focus instead on little renovations, which can return more money than you spent when it is time to sell. Large renovations often cost more money than they add to house\u2019s value.  ", " Remove personal items. Tons of family photos, knick-knacks, and personal items are a big turn-off for potential buyers. While you want to your house to feel homey, you don\u2019t want it to seem so personal that the next owner can\u2019t see themselves living in it. Hide any toys, books, computers, or keepsakes when people come see your house and limit the number of family photos scattered around the house if there is a picture of you on every wall.

The guide below covers a few of your options for paying for home repairs.", "content": {"Steps": [" Refinance your mortgage to obtain cash for home repairs. A popular way to pay for home repairs and renovations is through a \"cash-out refi,\" which is simply a way of swapping your existing mortgage for a new one and converting some of your home equity to cash in the process. Your current mortgage lender can help you understand your options for refinancing. Note that liquidating your equity in this way will generally cause your monthly payments or mortgage term to increase.  ", " Obtain a home equity line of credit. A home equity line of credit functions like a credit card, with an open-ended term, a credit limit, and a minimum monthly payment based on your outstanding balance. This type credit makes sense for financing home repairs or remodeling projects because these projects tend to increase your home equity anyway. ", " Seek out a second mortgage. A second mortgage can be an unattractive option as it can tend to overburden you with debt, but for home repairs with an end in sight they are helpful. A second mortgage is a loan secured on your accumulated equity. The interest rate will be higher because your primary mortgage lender is given preference over your new lender in case of insolvency; for this reason, try to keep the size of your second mortgage as small as possible.

These loans are made by banks and backed by the federal government, and can be used to finance essential repairs such as structural and electrical problems. ", " Use a credit card for small, emergency repairs. While credit cards typically carry higher interest rates than loans secured on your home equity, they make sense for funding small home repairs. A credit card is available for use immediately and requires no paperwork, unlike other financing options. ", " Borrow from your 401(k). Many employers allow borrowing from your 401(k) to fund home repairs and renovations. This option is low-hassle because the money is already yours, so there is no paperwork or credit check. However, you are required to pay the borrowed money back into your 401(k) before leaving the company.

Measure the width between the ceiling joists as well so you know the width of the insulation you need to buy.  ", " Pick R-11 or R-25 fiberglass insulation batts for the easiest installation. The R-value refers to how effective the insulation is compared to the climate in your area. If you live in a warmer climate with high humidity, opt for insulation batts that have at least an R-11 rating. If you live in a cold climate or an area that has temperatures that drop below freezing, choose R-25 insulation since it\u2019s thicker and will keep your home warmer. Make sure the batts you buy are the same width as the floor joists, or else they won\u2019t fit as well.  You can buy insulation batts from your local hardware or home improvement store. If there aren\u2019t batts that perfectly fit between your joists, then opt for a larger size so you can cut it down. Insulation that\u2019s too narrow will allow cold air through and make the insulation less effective.  ", " Wear safety glasses, a dust mask, and gloves to prevent irritation. Fiberglass insulation creates small particles that can cause irritation on your skin or in your lungs. Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes as well as a dust mask that covers your mouth and nose. Wear long-sleeved clothing, pants, and gloves to have the least amount of skin exposed.

Continue pressing the insulation in between each of the joists.  Don\u2019t let the insulation bunch up while you\u2019re working with it since it won\u2019t create an effective seal.

Wire supports fit between the ceiling joists and prevent the insulation from falling out. Position the support horizontally between the joists and push it up against the insulation so it doesn\u2019t compress any more than 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm). The ends of the support will stick into the wood so you don\u2019t need to secure it. Continue placing the supports along the length of the joists so the insulation doesn\u2019t move.  You can also staple landscaping paper between the joists to prevent the insulation from falling, but it may be more difficult to access or replace the batts.

When renovating your kitchen, avoid the temptation to introduce expensive, top-of-the-line appliances and fixtures. You will realize a higher return on your money by focusing on replacing old and worn flooring, wall coverings, and cabinetry with new mid-range products. Focus most of your attention on your master bathroom if you have one. Potential buyers like to see the master bath as an oasis of sorts, so updating the finishes and fixtures in this room will yield a high return.

This is particularly important for issues that you are not clear about or you did not understand. Here are some questions you need to ask each contractor: Did the Contractor omit a portion of the scope of work? If so, have them revise the estimate. Are they using lesser quality materials (paint, cabinets, tile, etc.)? How long will it take to complete the work? Are they insured with a General Liability policy? Can they provide a minimum of 5 to 10 references from previous projects? Are permits necessary and if so, is the cost included in the estimate? Is the Contractor willing to let you visit several of their jobs? What type of Warranty does the Contractor provide? If they do not understand what you are talking about, ask more questions. Good builders are the ones who know how to solve a problem. However, those who insist on answering your questions and want to explain you every little detail are the best.

It\u2019s easy enough for someone to say that you should get multiple estimates for any home improvement project, but a lot of people don\u2019t realize how long it can take a contractor to get to a job site to work up an estimate.  It\u2019s a good rule of thumb to begin soliciting estimates at least thirty days before you plan on signing a contract. A lot of contractors are small operations with only a few employees. What\u2019s more, home improvement contractors often cover a large geographic area since it\u2019s difficult to predict when and where a potential job will come from. They\u2019re busy people who do a lot of driving, so it may take a week or two for them to get to you. After the initial visit, it will probably take another week to get an estimate.

The internet age has made it possible for nearly anyone to work up a preliminary estimate all by themselves with just a few hours and the willingness to do some research.  There are many cost-estimation sites online, including Homewyze, HomeAdvisor, and This Old House. Some, like Homewyze, are more detailed than others. Depending on your online estimator\u2019s level of detail, you might need to measure square footage and make some preliminary decisions on materials\u2014like wood, vinyl, or laminate flooring\u2014to get an accurate estimate.  ", " Ask around to get the names of some reputable contractors. Since most people don\u2019t have the expertise to evaluate a contractor\u2019s work at a glance, they rely on word of mouth and consumer reviews to find contractors to work with. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that strategy, but it\u2019s not perfect. You should be aware of a few points:  ", " Evaluate the contractors' credentials. Start by checking online reviews. Many online review aggregators are less impartial then they may seem. Angie\u2019s List is one of the best review aggregators, and all of the ratings on Angie\u2019s List are legitimate. But even Angie\u2019s List allows highly rated contractors to pay to have their names come up first in the search results.  The same problem pops up with word of mouth referrals. For example, say you want to build a stone wall in your front yard. Your sister had a stone wall built a year ago, and it looks great, and she highly recommends the stonemason.  The problem is, structures are about more than looks\u2014they also have to be built soundly. How does your sister know she didn\u2019t pay for a beautiful wall that\u2019s going to fall over in three years? The contractor\u2019s experience is probably the best way to ease some of these anxieties. If they\u2019ve been working in your area for three decades, they come recommended, and they\u2019ve got good online reviews, then they\u2019re probably worth taking a look at. Check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) online to see their score, any previous complaints, and customer comments. Although most people won\u2019t do it, it\u2019s not a bad idea to conduct a personal background check on your contractor. If your contractor has defrauded people before, there\u2019s a good chance it was in another state\u2014because they won\u2019t be licensed in a state where they have committed fraud. A thorough background check can help to ferret out any troubling criminal history.  ", " Make a list of items that need to be covered in the estimate. If you only need one item repaired or replaced, this isn\u2019t as important. But if you\u2019re getting a lot of work done, make a list of everything that you might want taken care of.  For example, if you\u2019re just getting your windows replaced, you probably don\u2019t need a list to keep track of that. If you\u2019re getting your entire home remodeled, make a list.  ", " Meet the contractor at the job site. Never underestimate what you can learn from a face-to-face meeting. There are all kinds of details you might not catch over the phone or online. Walking the job site together with the contractor can also remind you of items you may have left off your list.  ", " Schedule estimates from at least three contractors. If you have time, schedule more. But you need to get at least three estimates, because without three, you\u2019ll never be able to tell if one estimate is an outlier.  Even beyond the price of an estimate, it\u2019s important to get three because a contractor might be wrong. Whether you\u2019re getting something repaired, replaced, remodeled, or built from scratch, there\u2019s a good chance the estimate from at least one contractor will be too high, too low, or for the wrong thing altogether. If one contractor tells you that you need to have your hot water heater replaced, and another says they can repair it, how do you know who\u2019s right? The third estimate might do the trick.  "], "Analyzing the Estimates you Receive": [" Take note of how long it takes to get the estimate. Unless a job is massive, it shouldn\u2019t take longer than a couple of weeks to get a estimate. What\u2019s probably more relevant than the amount of time it takes to get the estimate is the difference between how long they said it would take and how long it actually takes. Use your best judgement when weighing this factor. If it takes someone three weeks to tell you how much they\u2019ll charge to replace your garbage disposal, you probably want to avoid them. If you\u2019ve got a big job and the contractor can explain the reason for a delay and takes the initiative to tell you it\u2019s going to be late, then it\u2019s probably not reflective on their diligence.  ", " Pay attention to the level of detail in the estimate. Estimation is inherently inexact, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be inaccurate. A vague estimate should immediately strike you as unreliable. The bigger the job, the more detailed the estimate should be.   A small job can be less detailed, because there are fewer variables to consider.  All contractors should be bidding the same job under the same conditions. Otherwise, it will be hard to properly evaluate and compare offers. For example, if you\u2019re getting a ceiling fan installed, that\u2019s a small job. You pick the fan, which accounts for the cost of materials, so the only variable is labor. If your entire house is getting renovated and the contractor tells you the kitchen will cost $7,000, let that serve as a warning sign. Unless you\u2019ve already picked out the appliances, the countertops, fixtures, flooring and more, there\u2019s simply no way to know how much it will cost. The best a reputable contractor will do is give you range: \u201ckitchens of this size usually cost between $5,000 and $10,000.\u201d  ", " Identify the materials you want. Hidden costs can make an estimate appear to be great when it\u2019s anything but. One way of masking costs is to work up an estimate using the lowest grade materials or appliances available. Verify the contractor is using the materials or appliances you want used, and not just what\u2019s cheapest. ", " Include other conditions. Remember to state any other conditions or other requirements that will affect the job. For example, you may require that contractors work certain hours, have a distinct level of access to site, or require site maintenance. Include any special details when talking to contractors so that they can give you a comprehensive estimate. Examples of these conditions might include: Waste disposal and cleanup. Most large projects generate a lot of trash, dumpsters have to be rented and hazardous materials ( like asbestos) need to be disposed of by specialists.  Permits and inspections. Every home improvement project of any consequence is going to require some type of permit. Who is responsible for obtaining the permits and who pays for the inspectors?  Landscaping.  Large projects can do quite a bit of damage to a residential landscape. Who is responsible for returning the yard back to its original condition? Warranties.  Make sure that your contractor warranties their work. If they charge extra, do the math. Is the length of the warranty worth the cost?  ", " Compare the estimates. Compare the estimates you\u2019ve received from the contractors and the preliminary estimate you created. Is there one that\u2019s substantially higher or lower than the others? If so, is there a good reason why?  A lot of people will say to eliminate the high and low estimate right off the bat, but that\u2019s simply not good advice. If you only got three estimates, and one of them is much higher than the others, don\u2019t you want to know why? The high contractor might have spotted a problem the other two missed. The same principle applies to a very low estimate. That contractor may have identified a cheaper way of getting the job done than the other two that\u2019s equally as good. If you find yourself in that kind of dilemma, the best option may be to get another estimate from a fourth contractor. Ask for an explanation when costs vary significantly. Does one contractor see a problem another missed or does one wants the job more and is willing to take a lower profit?  "], "Picking an Estimate": [" Tell the contractors about each other\u2019s estimates. It\u2019s far from certain that it will change anyone\u2019s estimate, but you might be able to get a better deal if you tell the contractors what your other offers are. Inform them of the other offers respectfully. Don\u2019t accuse anyone of trying to cheat you or take advantage, because most of the time, they aren\u2019t.  Not every contractor pays the same price for materials or labor. Plus, a lot of the variation is based on what a contractor thinks his crews can do and how they\u2019ll have to do it.  ", " Confirm the details. Before you commit to a specific contractor, make sure you know exactly what\u2019s included in the estimate.

Perhaps there are things on the list for staying that you cannot see in your current situation. For example, you may have a lovely home but no space to extend, or your neighbours will probably object if you seek planning permission to build an upper level to your home. Perhaps, however, some of the reasons for leaving your home can be overcome with good planning and advice. For example, additional space gains can often be made to an existing home in an aesthetic way that provides little inconvenience if you head off to the cottage for a month or two during the worst of the renovations. It is important to talk to your architect and/or builder about the possibilities before giving up on fixing your existing home. A financial adviser or lawyer can also assist with advice on the potential for over-capitalization and this may be enough to allay any concerns. ", " Go with your instincts. Sometimes it is as simple as it being time to leave the place you have spent many years in. Energy can be renewed and family spirits lifted by a change of view, location and lifestyle possibilities.

One of the most important ways to survive hotel living is to know when your family \u201ctogetherness\u201d will end.  Typically contractors may give you an end date, but will most likely be extended beyond that specific day. Add at least one week onto the contractor\u2019s end date.  For your mental health, if your contractor tells you the job will only last one week, get it into your mind that you will out of the house for two. Request a detailed written plan that lets you know what work should be done on which days.  If you are having your kitchen gutted, knowing that day six is counter top day will let you know whether the team is on schedule or running behind when you check on the house. Collect all contact numbers and information from the contractor.  The contractor will be your best resource to getting back into the house.  Having easy access to the company and the lead contractor will allow you to stay on top of the timeline.   ", " Select the right hotel. Although you may be inclined to want to save money and stay in a cheap motel (most likely because the renovation is costing an arm and a leg), consider reserving a (or several) rooms at a nicer hotel.  You don't need to check into the Ritz Carlton but keep in mind you will be staying there for more than one evening and your comfort will wane as the days/weeks plod on. Consider booking a suite or a room with multiple rooms and a kitchen. The more like home you can make your new surroundings, the better.  Numerous hotels have cropped up across the world aimed at busy executives or families on the go that contain a kitchen, numerous rooms and even an in-room washer and dryer. Investigate renting a condo or a home. If you think you will be out of your home for more than a month, signing a short-term lease on a home or condo may be the best option. Not only will you be able to spread out more, you may end up saving money in the long run.  ", " Pack sensibly for your stay away from home. While you may be used to packing \u201cvacation\u201d wear for hotel stays, keep in mind that you aren\u2019t on vacation and will need the same items at the hotel as you do at home. Avoid over packing, especially if you plan to stay close to home. Instead of bringing everything from formal evening attire to your swimsuit, keep in mind that you can run back and forth and grab items as you need them.  Instead, pack for three to four days and then go home an repack.  Also, if the weather or your mood changes, you can grab clothing as you need it and not end up with piles and piles of clothing all over the hotel room--too much clutter will send anyone to the funny farm. Bring creature comforts to the hotel room. Especially for kids, bring favorite toys or stuffed animals to keep everyone comfortable and feeling as if they are at home.  If you have a favorite book or if you knit, bring your hobby or reading materials along for long family evenings of togetherness. If you book accommodations with a kitchen check to see if the kitchen comes equipped with everything you need. For example if you are a coffee drinker, make sure the kitchen comes with a coffee maker. If not, you may want to bring one from home.  ", " Stick to your regular schedule.

Determine how long it will take you to get to your destination each morning.  Most likely you know how long it will take to drive the kids to school from your home, but may be unfamiliar with traffic patterns and the amount of time from the hotel.  Try a dry run and then pad travel time by 10 to 30 minutes depending on how far you are from your destination--who knows, maybe you are closer traveling from the hotel. Establish a specific space for each family member.  Since everyone will most likely not have their own room, allot a certain space within your accommodations to allow each family member to keep possessions and/or chill out. Create a new routine. If you stay at home with the kids and typically spend time cleaning, decorating or gardening, consider creating a new routine so you don\u2019t go stir crazy.  Make lunch plans with friends, go to a movie, volunteer at your child\u2019s school, schedule doctor appointments you put off, visit your home to check on the renovation or go to the gym.  Sitting around the hotel room will make you go nuts so being busy is key.  ", " Take a vacation. While it may not be financially feasible, taking a vacation from your hotel room can give you a new perspective. A quick getaway from your environment can mix up the monotony of being stuck in a hotel room, even though you will most likely be going from a hotel room to another. Plan renovations around vacation.  Kids on spring break?  Schedule your renovation during your spring break vacation so you only have to spend a short amount of time in the hotel near home.

Additionally, wear protective eyewear.   ", " Place a piece of foam underneath your light fixture. Line the bottom of your box with foam so you can easily move your fixture by dragging the foam's corners. Foam also gives your fixture a soft floor that won't scratch it. As you paint, you can continuously rotate the foam so that you get all sides of the fixture.  Pebble style foam is ideal because the spray paint won't melt it. This kind of foam typically comes packaged with TVs and knock-down furniture. Styrofoam can easily melt if the spray paint is applied too close to the surface of the foam.

Over time, veneers may warp, raise off the surface, or chip due to heat or regular wear and tear. Luckily, there are ways to make the veneers lie flat on the surface so they look like new. If the edges lift up or there\u2019s bubbling in the middle of the veneer, glue it back down to flatten it. If the veneer chipped or has severe discoloration, you can replace the section with wood filler or a new veneer patch. With the right tools, you\u2019ll be able to fix your furniture within 1\u20132 days!", "content": {"Gluing Lifted Edges": [" Scrape off the dry glue underneath the veneer with a file or paperclip. Carefully lift the edge of the veneer so you can fit the file or paperclip underneath it. Rub the surface under the veneer with the file to break down any leftover glue that\u2019s still stuck on the furniture. Blow away the dust so you can see your work area clearly. Continue removing as much of the glue as possible.  Be careful not to pry the veneer too far up since you could cause it to break or snap.   ", " Spread wood glue onto the surface under the veneer using a palette knife. Apply a bead of wood glue along the edge of a palette knife and lift the veneer with your nondominant hand. Position the blade of the knife between the veneer and piece of furniture and scrape it over the wood. Try to make the layer as thin and even as possible to ensure proper adhesion.  Palette knives have flat, flexible heads so you can easily spread glue in tight areas. You can buy them from an art supply or hardware store. If you don\u2019t have a palette knife, you can also spread the glue with a toothpick.  ", " Press the veneer down and wipe away excess glue with a damp shop cloth. Wet a shop cloth with warm water and wring it out completely. Push down firmly on the top of the veneer to help spread the glue out more. Work from the center of the raised area toward the edges to force any excess glue out from the sides. Wipe any glue that comes out with the cloth so it doesn\u2019t dry.  Push lightly for the first few times to help flatten large bubbles of glue underneath the veneer. Avoid leaving the wood glue on furniture since it will be more difficult to remove later on.  ", " Lay a piece of wax paper on the veneer. Set a sheet of wax paper over the edge with the shiny side face-down so it covers the entire glued area. Make sure you have about 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) of wax paper extending past the glued section so glue is less likely to leak out the sides.  If you don\u2019t use wax paper, the glue may ooze out and stick to clamps later on.  ", " Clamp a flat piece of wood on top of the wax paper and leave it overnight. Choose a piece of wood that has a flat side large enough to cover the glued section. Lay the wood over the wax paper and secure it to your work surface with a C-clamp. Add additional C-clamps every 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) down the length of the wood so it doesn\u2019t rise up away from the veneer. Leave the clamps on the wood overnight so the wood has time to dry.  Clamping the veneer down ensures it\u2019s flat against the furniture so it\u2019s less likely to develop blisters or damage in the future. You can buy C-clamps from your local hardware store. You can use any scrap piece of wood as long as it has a flat surface and covers any section you glued.  ", " Clean off any dried glue with a damp shop cloth or abrasive pad. Wet a shop cloth with warm water and wring out so it doesn\u2019t drip. Lightly rub over the edges to see if any excess dried glue comes off. If the glue still sticks on the exterior of the vinyl, use an abrasive sponge and apply light pressure to break it down.  Avoid applying firm pressure while you\u2019re removing glue since you could scrape through the veneer\u2019s surface and make it discolored.  "], "Flattening Blisters in Veneer": [" Cut a slit in the middle of the blister with a utility knife to drain out the air. Position your cut so it runs with the wood grain to make it less noticeable. Push a utility knife lightly into the veneer until you pierce through the other side. Make the slit about half the length of the blister so you can easily poke a syringe inside of it later on.  Blisters occur when you set something hot on the veneer, which separates the adhesive from the wood to create a bubbled area on the surface. Always cut away from your body so you don\u2019t injure yourself if the knife slips.  ", " Apply wood glue on the surface inside the blister with a syringe. Get a wood glue syringe from your local hardware store and remove the cap on the needle. Put the needle in one side of the slit on the veneer and press down on the plunger. Move the needle tip around the inside of the blister to spread the glue evenly. Then apply glue to the other side of the slit in the same way.  If you don\u2019t have a wood glue syringe, you can spread wood glue with a toothpick or palette knife.  ", " Press down on the blistered veneer to spread the glue. Push from the edges of the blister toward the slit in the center. Apply firm pressure as you work to help create a thin, even layer of glue underneath the blister. Try to make the blister as flat as possible so it adheres to the surface easier.  If any excess glue comes out from the slit, wipe it away with a damp shop cloth.  ", " Set wax paper over the blistered veneer. Tear off a sheet of wax paper that extends about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\u00a0cm) around the blister on each side. Put the wax paper with the shiny side face-down so it presses against the veneer.  Wax paper helps prevent the clamps from sticking to the veneer if glue oozes out from the blister.  ", " Clamp a flat piece of wood over the veneer and leave it overnight. Set a flat piece of wood on top of the wax paper that\u2019s large enough to cover the entire blister. Secure a C-clamp to your piece of furniture or work surface so it holds the wood block tightly against the veneer. Put additional clamps every 1 foot (30\u00a0cm) if the block doesn\u2019t stay flat against the veneer. Leave the veneer clamped overnight so the wood glue has time to set.  Avoid removing the clamp or wood block any earlier since the veneer could still raise off the furniture and form another blister.  ", " Sand the dried glue on top of the veneer with 180-grit sandpaper. Take off the clamps, wood block, and wax paper so you can see your repair. Apply light pressure as you work 180-grit sandpaper over the slit. Remove the dried glue around the hole and continue smoothing out the edges until they\u2019re flush with the rest of the veneer.  Don\u2019t press too hard with the sandpaper, or you may sand through the veneer and cause discoloration. Blow the dust away or wipe it off with a damp cloth periodically so you can see what you\u2019re doing.  "], "Using Wood Filler for Chips": [" Tape around the chipped area if it\u2019s along the edge of the veneer. Attach a strip of painter\u2019s tape along the outer edge of the furniture so it extends about 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) over the surface. Make sure the tape forms clean, straight walls around the outer edges of the veneer. Continue applying tape around any corners or sides that have chips.  Painter\u2019s tape helps form straight, clean edges with the wood filler. This works well if you\u2019re fixing chips in the corners of drawers or along a table\u2019s edge. You don\u2019t need to apply tape if you\u2019re filling chips that aren\u2019t along the edge.  ", " Combine wood filler and hardener on a paper plate. Read the mixing directions on the wood filler packaging and add enough to a paper plate to fill in the chips on your furniture. Add the listed amount of the hardening solution and mix it into the filler with a stir stick. Continue stirring the wood filler until it gets tacky.  You can buy wood filler from your local hardware store. Make sure to use a stainable wood filler if you want to match the color of the original veneer. If you plan on painting over the veneer later on, then you can use any wood filler. Work quickly after combining the wood filler and hardener since it will start setting with 15 minutes and be difficult to work with.  ", " Press the wood filler into the damaged sections with a plastic scraper. Scoop the wood filler off of the paper plate with a plastic scraper and push it into the area that\u2019s damaged. Move the scraper in multiple directions while applying firm pressure so the filler works deeper into the wood and veneers. Make sure corners and edges are as straight as possible. Scrape the surface flat and remove any excess wood filler.  If you have trouble scooping or pressing the wood filler into the chipped sections, it may have dried out before you were able to use it. Scoop out as much as you can before combining more wood filler with hardener.  ", " Allow the filler to dry for about 15\u201320 minutes. Leave the wood filler alone in a dry place so it has time to harden. Lightly tap on the wood filler after 15 minutes to see if it\u2019s solid. If it still feels wet, allow it to dry for another 10\u201315 minutes before checking again.  Wood filler may take up to 2 hours to completely set if you filled in large areas.  ", " Sand the wood filler with 140-grit sandpaper so it\u2019s flush with the veneer. Remove any tape around the wood filler before rubbing any rough edges with 140-grit sandpaper. Work in the same direction as the wood grain on the veneer to help the wood filler blend in easier. Apply light pressure to get rid of raised seams or uneven applications until they feel smooth.  Be careful not to oversand since it will make the surface look uneven.  ", " Apply stain to the wood filler so it matches the veneer. Test the stain on an inconspicuous area of the wood filler first to ensure the color matches the rest of the veneer. Brush the stain on with a paintbrush and follow the direction of the wood grain so it blends in easier. Allow the stain to dry completely, which usually takes 6\u20138 hours.  Try using a wood stain marker if you\u2019re filling in sections smaller than 1 square inch (6.5\u00a0cm ). You don\u2019t need to apply stain if you plan on painting over the veneer and wood filler.  "], "Patching Heavily Damaged Veneer": [" Stain a piece of replacement veneer to the same color as the original. Use a stain color that matches the color of the existing veneer and test it on a scrap piece to ensure it\u2019s the same color. Paint a layer of the stain onto the replacement veneer with a paintbrush and wipe off any excess with a shop cloth along the wood grain. Let the stain dry for 6\u20138 hours before using the replacement veneer.  Be sure to use veneer that's the same thickness as the original, or else it won't look cohesive.  ", " Cut a diamond-shaped patch from the replacement veneer. Make the patch large enough so it completely covers the damaged area you\u2019re replacing. Align the wood grain so it\u2019s at a 45-degree angle to the sides. Use a utility knife and a straightedge to cut out your patch.  Diamond-shaped patches help you hide the seams between the replacement and original veneers since they\u2019ll be at an angle.  ", " Trace the outline of the patch around the damaged veneer. Set your patch over the damaged area so the edges are at an angle to the wood grain and the grain matches between the replacement and original veneers. Hold the patch firmly in place with your nondominant hand and trace around it with a pencil. Make your lines dark enough so you\u2019re able to see them while you\u2019re working. Set the patch aside while you\u2019re working for now.  Always work directly from the patch rather than taking measurements since you may cut the shape or position it incorrectly.  ", " Slice through the veneer along the outline using a utility knife. Place a straightedge against your outline and press a blade into the veneer at the start of your cut. Only push the blade deep enough to cut through the veneer, which is usually about in (0.32\u00a0cm) thick. Pull the blade along the outline to loosen the veneer around the area you\u2019re patching.  If you press too far down with the blade, you could damage the wood underneath. Always move the blade away from your body you don\u2019t get hurt if the knife slips.  ", " Chisel off the old veneer and glue from the damaged area. Place the sharp, flat end of the chisel against the bottom edge of the veneer. Hold the chisel near horizontal and push it forward lift up the old veneer. Work in small, short strokes so you don\u2019t damage or gouge the wood underneath. Work toward the outline you cut with your knife and throw away the old veneer pieces as they chip off.  If you have trouble guiding the chisel through the veneer, lightly tap on the end of the handle with a hammer or mallet to help force it through. If you accidentally gouge into the wood underneath the veneer, fill it in with wood filler and allow it to cure before attaching the patch.  ", " Apply hide glue to the chiseled furniture surface. Apply the hide glue directly onto the clean surface where you want to place your patch. Use a palette knife or a plastic scraper to spread the glue over the entire surface to create a thin, even layer. Work quickly after applying the glue since it begins setting within 15\u201320 minutes.  You can buy hide glue from your local hardware store. Avoid using wood glue since it may not adhere as well.  ", " Set the veneer patch and a sheet of wax paper onto the glued surface. Position the veneer patch onto the piece of furniture so all of the seams like up. When you\u2019re happy with the placement, press the patch down onto the glue so it stays in place. Put a piece of wax paper with the shiny side down over the patch to help protect it.  Wax paper prevents the hide glue from sticking to any clamps or pieces of wood holding the patch down. If you place the patch incorrectly, try lifting it out of the glue and repositioning it as soon as possible.  ", " Clamp a flat piece of wood over the patch until the glue dries. Choose a piece of wood that\u2019s larger enough to cover the entire patch and place it on top of the wax paper. Secure C-clamps every 1 foot (30\u00a0cm) around the piece of wood to hold the patch tightly against the furniture. Leave the wood clamped overnight so the glue has time to set.  Make sure to distribute pressure evenly on the piece of wood or one side of the patch may set higher than the other.  ", " Sand the surface with 180-grit sandpaper to remove residual glue. Take off the clamps and remove the piece of wood and wax paper from the patch. Rub 180-grit sandpaper along the wood grain, focusing on any raised seams or dried glue on the surface. Apply light pressure so you don\u2019t wear through the veneer. Keep sanding until the patch is flush with the original veneer.
