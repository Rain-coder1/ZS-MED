Make a list of the bride's favorite songs or make a wedding playlist in the theme of the shower, like beach music.  A great wedding-themed playlist can include songs like \"Chapel of Love\" by the Dixie Cups, \"White Wedding\" by Billy Idol, \"Let's Get Married\" by the Proclaimers, \"Band of Gold\" by Freda Payne, \"With this Ring\" by the Platters,  \"Not Too Young To Get Married\" by Bob E.

Give everyone a card that has squares referring to people the bride knows, such as a colleague, childhood friend, sister or aunt. A guest gets a bingo if she meets people from different areas of her life and fills in the names of those people. You can also do an icebreaker in the style of a scavenger hunt. Make a list of interesting facts and give it to the guests. They have to find who traveled to Mexico with the bride in 2000 or who gave her her first hair cut.  ", " Pick games that reflect the audience that will attend the shower. For example, do not play bawdy games with the bride's mother in attendance. Do not play games that make people talk about their relationship, if you have invited many single people.  If your bride does not seem like the type to enjoy indoor games, play croquet or bocce ball instead. This is a great idea if she is sporty. Popular bridal shower games include making a wedding dress out of toilet paper for the bride or for each guest, playing trivia about the bride's life, write poetry or limericks. Play purse bingo, where you get points for common items found in a purse, like a hairbrush, safety pin or pen. Each person allots themselves points according to what they have in their purse and the one with the highest score wins.

Not only do flowers make beautiful, high-impact decorations, they are also great take-home gifts for the bride and groom, so if you have a chance to splurge, do so on flowers.  It\u2019s often cheaper to rent tables, chairs, and linens for an event rather than purchase them, so look into that option if desired. If the colors of the shower are navy and white, for example, choose navy tablecloths and white napkins.

This will help you relax and truly enjoy the process!", "content": {"Creating a Plan": [" Talk to the bride about the guest list. Unless the shower is a surprise, it is a good idea to get as much input as possible from the bride. Traditionally, a bridal shower is for the bride, her bridesmaids, and other close female friends and family. She may want to stick to this tradition or she may want to include older family members, children, or even partners of her friends. This is valuable information when choosing a theme and deciding on your decorations. If there are going to be children there, for example, you will want to avoid decorating with precious, breakable items within their reach. You might also consider creating a designated space for them to gather and play.   ", " Determine the shower's location. The bride may feel strongly about hosting an event-style shower like a spa day or a horseback riding trip. Decorations for this type of shower are minimal and need to be portable and simple, so this is an important distinction to make up front. An event shower will save you money on decorations, but they are generally more expensive all around. The host is responsible for organizing the details, but the cost is generally split evenly between all of the participants except the bride.

Unless the shower is a surprise, ask the bride about her thoughts on a theme. When you discuss the theme with the bride, watch for her level of interest and enthusiasm when you discuss certain ideas. For example, she may not care very much about the colors you choose, but she suddenly becomes passionate when you talk about the flowers or a make-your-own cocktail bar. If the bride-to-be is stressed out, consider a spa day or a less expensive at-home self-care day that includes pedicures, facials, and yummy smoothies. For a movie buff, choose a film-inspired shower that includes champagne, popcorn, and several great movies.   ", " Choose colors or a d\u00e9cor style as an alternative to a theme. Even if you and the bride decide you don't want to adhere to a theme, designating colors and/or a particular style of d\u00e9cor can help keep your choices focused and coherent. Think of visual styles like shabby chic, rustic/nature, or modern art. If the bride is a French wine enthusiast, consider a French country look for your decorations. When in doubt, choose the colors of the wedding for the shower decorations. Alternatively, you could pick the bride\u2019s favorite color and create your look using different shades of that color with splashes of white mixed in.   ", " Stick to your budget. It is easy to go overboard on spending, especially when the party is for a beloved friend on a special occasion. That\u2019s why it is important to decide on an amount you are comfortable spending on decorations at the outset. Make sure you take into consideration any additional costs: food, alcohol, invitations, catering, or housecleaning just to name a few. It is perfectly acceptable to ask several other guests to co-host with you and share the expense.  Pick one thing that you think the bride would really appreciate and splurge on that. For instance, if the theme is Marie Antoinette, go for it on the tarts and cakes, but commit to keeping other costs down.  Look around your home to see if you already have things that might fit the theme. For example, if you are hosting a Kentucky Derby-themed shower, use your horse-head bookends to decorate the food table or bar.   ", " Make or borrow some of the decorations to save money. Handmade decorations tend to be more personal as well as less expensive. Enlist some of the other guests to get crafty with you. And don't be afraid to reach out and ask for items that you need. You may not have the perfect cupcake platter, but the bride\u2019s best friend from high school might!  Banners, signs, and are great items to make by hand. Have each guest make a flower out of decorative paper with a note on the back.

Attach helium balloons to your sign, the mailbox, or the porch for extra visibility. Match the balloon colors to the colors you\u2019ve used to decorate inside. Consider making a sign that fits the theme. If you\u2019ve chosen a film theme, for example, make your sign look like a marquee. A banner on the door could say the bride\u2019s name plus the groom\u2019s name or something simple like \u201clove\u201d or \"amour.\" If the party is at night, consider creating some ambiance with a string of outdoor lights around the door or the sign.

Place the table close to the front door so the guests can set down their gift first thing. Cover the table with a pretty tablecloth that ties into the rest of your d\u00e9cor. Place a sign on the table to let your guests know it is for gifts. Resist the urge to add anything else to the table because it will just get moved!

Hang it on the front of the table to save the space for gifts.  ", " Make the food table the party\u2019s centerpiece. Since everyone eventually congregates around the food table, make it the highlight of your shower\u2019s decorations. Splurge on the bride\u2019s favorite flowers to adorn the table. Choose platters of varying heights to make the most of your space and to create an eye-catching composition of the food. Add a framed photograph of the bride and groom. If you are hosting a potluck style shower, plan on re-plating the food so the plates, bowls and platters create a coherent look. Avoid having any commercial jars or packaging on the table. Plating everything will maintain the elegance of the table. Consider a menu board or labels for the food items, especially if your theme is food related. For an English tea party theme, use dainty, old-fashioned floral stationary to make your signs. If the decorations are French country, choose a chalk board to list food items. Choose flowers or candles that are mildly scented. You always want the food to be the star of the olfactory parade!  ", " Create a separate space for drinks and drink-making. A create-your-own-cocktail bar can be a fun addition to the party. You may want to put it in the kitchen and refrain from using a tablecloth, making clean-up easier. Don't forget to include some festive non-alcoholic options for the non-drinkers. Soda water mixed with cranberry juice or fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice look good and taste good. Drinks can also be tied into a theme. If you are having a inspired party, serve prohibition-era cocktails.  ", " Decorate a chair for the bride-to-be. Have fun creating a throne for her to sit on while she is opening her gifts. Make a sign or banner that says her name or simply \u201cbride-to-be.\u201d Provide a tiara, flower crown, or traditional veil for her to wear while she is opening her gifts.  Don\u2019t forget the practical items that gift opening can require: several pairs of scissors, a trash bag for discarded wrapping paper, and tissues. As hostess of the party, count on providing yourself with a notebook and pen so you can jot down who gave what so the bride can send out thank you notes later.   ", " Make or buy take-home party favors for your guests. Choose a small, inexpensive memento that ties into the theme or mood of your shower. The best take-home gifts from a shower evoke memories of the day. Avoid kitschy gifts that will likely be thrown away and add a personalized decorative touch to store-bought items. For a spa-themed party, send your guests home with a pouch of herb and flower scented bath salt, a scented votive candle, and/or a beautiful bar of fragrant soap. Consider creating mini-bouquets out of the party\u2019s floral arrangements. Purchase mini-vases and send each guest home with fresh flowers.

The bride\u2019s maid of honor and bridesmaids are oftentimes some of her closest friends and relatives, so it\u2019s important that they are included in the shower. Invite all female attendants, even the ones who live out of town.  Attendants who live out of town may not be able to make it, but it\u2019s still considered good etiquette to include them. Make sure to include the flower girl and anyone else who might be playing a role in the ceremony. Ask the bride for a complete list of all her attendants to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally overlook someone.  ", " Invite the bride\u2019s closest friends. Ask the bride to make a list of her closest friends, outside her bridal party. These are the women who should be included in the bridal shower. If the bride is having trouble narrowing this down, ask her to go through the list and point out her best friend(s) from growing up, her closest friends from college and her current group of closest friends.  You should not invite every female on the wedding guest list, so feel free to be picky in selecting the friends invited to the shower. Choose whether or not you want to invite close friends who live out of state. It\u2019s a nice gesture to do so, but they may feel compelled to send a gift, even if they can\u2019t attend, which might make them feel put on the spot.  ", " Invite local relatives. If there are any female family members who live close to where the shower is being held, feel free to invite them as well. This can include mothers and stepmothers on both sides, grandmothers on both sides and close female aunts and cousins on both sides.  Do not go overboard with the relatives. Aim to keep your guest list below 35 people, tops.  Don\u2019t double up on invites. Sometimes, different groups of people throw different showers for the bride; for instance, the bride might get a family shower and a shower held by close friends. Avoid overlap between the guest lists, as this just puts more pressure on guests to spend more money and buy more gifts.   ", " Invite the bride. Unless the shower is a surprise, make sure you invite the bride. And if the shower is a surprise, make sure you save an invitation and give it to her later; she\u2019ll appreciate the thought and the souvenir of the special day.  If the shower is a surprise, make sure that is clearly communicated on the invitations. You don\u2019t want someone accidentally spoiling the day! Depending on the shower and who is throwing it, you may also choose to invite the groom. If you do choose to do this, stagger the groom\u2019s arrival so he shows up after the party is well underway.

Couples showers are co-ed, so you\u2019ll need to invite all the attendants across both sides of the aisle.

If the person officiating the wedding is a close friend of the bride and/or groom, invite them as well. Feel free to invite out of town attendants, but be aware they may not come.

Just because you\u2019re celebrating both the bride and groom, doesn\u2019t mean the shower should be twice as big.  Make sure guests know ahead of time that the shower is co-ed so they aren\u2019t caught off guard. Do not invite the bride or groom\u2019s work friends, unless the relationship is especially close.  ", " Decide if you want to invite local relatives. Couples showers are generally far less traditional than the typical bridal shower, and some older relatives may not be comfortable with that. Choose whether or not you want to include local relatives, but know that you are not required to do so.  At the very least, invite parents and siblings on both sides. If your list of attendants skews more towards family, you might want to err on the side of inviting more family, so no one feels excluded.  ", " Invite the bride and groom. Oftentimes, couples showers are planned by the couple themselves, but if you're planning the shower for them, don't forget to include them when you send out invitations. Some planners prefer to use different invites for the men and women. This is not necessary, but it is a nice touch if you're so inclined. If the shower is a surprise for the couple, do not send the invite in advance. Save it and present it to them at or after the shower as a keepsake.

Depending on who is throwing the shower, you may want to keep it small and invite only the bride\u2019s closest colleagues.  If the bride has worked at the office for a long time, try reaching out to former co-workers who have already left, who the bride has strong relationships with. If the bride has good ties to vendors or other partners of that company, consider inviting those people as well.  ", " Invite the bride\u2019s team. If the bride\u2019s boss or a member of her work team is throwing the shower, invite everyone else on that team as well. Make the shower into a team bonding experience and make sure everyone feels included.  Make sure the team goes in on one gift, so nobody feels obligated to buy something independently. If the shower is being held off-site, consider inviting the groom to show up half-way through the event.  ", " Invite the whole office. If the bride has worked at the company for a long time or holds a very visible position, consider making the invite open to everyone. This way, no one feels excluded, but no one feels coerced into attending either.  If the office is springing for a gift, make sure people are aware they are not required to contribute. This can be awkward for people who don\u2019t know the bride well. Office showers do not need to be restricted just to people who are attending the wedding.

No, you're not sneaking out of the house; you're checking with the bride's friends and family to see if a shower is already planned. It isn't a good idea to throw two parties if the same people will be at both! Consider these possibilities: If you are the bride-to-be's co-worker and would like to throw an bridal shower, you're less likely to run into interference. If you're the bride's mother, feel free to plan a shower for your daughter; however, be aware that in some parts of the world it is considered to be general wedding etiquette that the bride's mother does not plan a bridal shower as it is thought better left to others to plan and that it lacks taste to have the mother doing this. Note, however, that more people are ignoring this little \"rule\" and doing it anyway. It's up to your discretion.   ", " Talk to the bride. That is, if you don't want a shower that's a complete surprise. With all the general fuss of a wedding, it may be best to talk to the bride, though. You want to avoid inviting people to the shower who aren't invited to the reception and you want to make sure the shower is in line with the bride-to-be's wishes. Does she want a co-ed shower? What dates and times are best for her? Where would she want it at? If you like the idea of the bride being minimally involved, just ask about the guest list and date -- she probably figures she's having a shower anyway. The theme and details can be up to you and the rest of the bridesmaids or close family.  ", " Choose a location. Now comes the best part! Whether it's the beach , a restaurant, or fancy hotel, the location of the shower can change everything. If you do decide to go with a specific theme, your location should reflect this. You probably wouldn't want to bring the bride's elderly aunts to a smoke-filled bar and grill. Sometimes the shower is held at a relatives' home, or the maid of honor's, or even the bride's place. Consider a nice area, a yacht, or a bonfire/cookout in the backyard. Your location should match both the bride's personality and your budget.  ", " Decide on a date. Traditionally, the wedding shower isn't held until a month before the wedding, but these days people are less inclined to follow this norm and choose a date to suit their own needs. Just be sure that the couple has had the opportunity to tell everyone about the wedding first. You don't want to step on anyone's toes! Make sure that all the necessary people will be available for this day. Once you have found a day that works for everyone, call the venue, if you're not having it at someone's home, to make reservations.  ", " Compile the guest list. Ask for some names from the bride herself, as well as from the mother of the bride. If another shower is being planned, try not to invite those same people to yours. It's ridiculous to expect someone to buy two -\u2014 and sometimes even three -\u2014 gifts for one person! Also, beware of inviting those who aren't also invited to the wedding itself.

As you're doing this, compile a list of addresses to send the real invitations out to. In your email, request their information if you don't already have it.  ", " Pick a theme. It will help direct both the mood of the shower party and can even impact the gifts. Consider a classic \"Round the Clock\" shower, where every guest gets a certain time of day to buy their gift for. Those with 7 a.m. could give the bride breakfast items, whereas those with 6 p.m. may gift the couple with dinner plates and napkins. Another idea is to have a location theme: Hawaiian, French, Chinese, or Spanish works well. Or, tailor your theme to the location: if the shower is at the beach, an obvious choice is to have a luau or theme. Choose a theme. Ask that guests not bring gifts but donate money to charity instead. This in consideration of the reality that you will receive wedding gifts anyway and a shower seeking gifts is akin to double dipping and can irritate potential wedding guests.  ", " Set a budget . Bridal showers can run from the very inexpensive to the extremely pricey, depending on your location and number of guests. Enlist a few of the bride's friends to help plan (and pay!) for the shower. Be sensible, however, as most of the money should go to the wedding and reception and not be eaten up by a wedding shower party. If you're a bridesmaid or maid of honor, consider asking all the girls to pitch in. A group effort will not only lessen the limits of your purse strings, but it will also help the shower itself run much more smoothly. Get together with the girls to decide on the decorations, menu, party favors, flowers, activities and the like. Give each person a specific to-do list to make all the duties manageable. If any of the team has connections (or is particularly crafty), the details can be sorted out. You don't necessarily need a theme now, but knowing what is and is not reasonable will help lessen the burden on your shoulders.

If you're throwing a beach-themed shower, pick up some tiki torches, palm trees, and grass skirts. Balloons, crepe paper streamers, banners, table centerpieces, plates -- the list of available items goes on and on. Abandoning the feel of the shower entirely is also a legitimate option.

Her answers will become so messy, you'll have the whole room laughing.  If the mother of the bride or groom is present, take caution (depending on her personality).  Before the party, obtain a picture of the groom. Buy balloons. Also gather photos of sexy, hunky men. Roll the pictures up tight and tie with a ribbon or rubber band.

Before you can plan the layout for your wedding shower, it\u2019s important to determine how much space is available in the yard.

In addition to the table(s) for guests, you may want to include a table for the gifts and one for the cake or desserts. At a backyard wedding shower, it\u2019s also a good idea to set up a so guests can help themselves to cocktails and other beverages. You can use a table or a kitchen cart depending on the size of the yard. It\u2019s also important to make sure that there\u2019s enough room for the grill at a barbecue wedding shower. Verify that there will be enough space around it for the cook(s) to work comfortably.   ", " Add adequate seating. In addition to tables where guests can eat, you\u2019ll want to include some other seating options so guests can mingle throughout the shower. Simple benches work well, as do folding lawn chairs.  More formal outdoor furniture, such as a wicker chair or loveseat, is also a nice option. If you want the barbecue shower to have an informal, picnic-like feel, lay down some blankets in the grass and add large pillows or cushions for guests to sit on.

Depending on the time of day that you hold the shower and how shady the yard is, you may want to consider adding some type of sun coverings to protect guests from the harsh rays. Simple outdoor umbrellas work well, but you can also purchase small portable tents that you can place in extremely sunny areas in the yard.  If the yard has no shade at all and you\u2019re holding the shower in the middle of the day, you may want to rent a large tent to cover the entire area. Make sure that the areas where you plan to keep the food and beverages are properly shielded too. Food can spoil more quickly when left out in the hot sun.

Moving the shower indoors in the event that it rains is usually the easiest option if your house is large enough.  A large rented tent can be an effective option if you want to hold the shower rain or shine. You may decide that you want to postpone if the weather is bad. If that\u2019s the case, list the backup date on the invitation so friends and family can keep that day and time available too -- and set a specific time for when you\u2019ll decide to cancel the event, such as the night before or the morning of.

You may want to hire caterers to handle the barbecuing so you can enjoy time with your guests and the guest(s) of honor.  Many catering companies or barbecue restaurants are equipped to handle barbecues. They will supply the food, and in most cases, the grill equipment, so you only have to worry about having the room to accommodate them. Catering the shower will obviously cost more than preparing the barbecue yourself, so it\u2019s not the best option if you\u2019re on a budget.

No matter what type of shower you\u2019re hosting, it\u2019s usually easier to serve the food buffet-style. However, at a backyard barbecue event, it\u2019s an especially good idea because serving guests one by one takes a long time. Set up a table or two to place the food, plates, and cutlery on, and allow the guests to help themselves.  If you\u2019re concerned about the food from the grill getting cold, use chafing dishes to keep the dishes warm. You can find chafing dishes, racks, and fuel at any party supply store.

Because barbecuing the main course will take some time, it\u2019s best to choose simple hors d\u2019oeuvres or appetizers that don\u2019t require much -- or any -- cooking time. For example, simple skewers with fresh vegetables, fruit, and cheese can be a tasty appetizer that you can prepare ahead of time. Your favorite dip or spread with an assortment of crackers or breadsticks also works well.  Make a simple antipasto platter with fresh cheeses, salami, olives, and roasted red peppers, and serve it with crackers or bread. If you want hot appetizers, consider making a couple of pizzas that you can cook right on the grill. Add your favorite toppings, and cut them into bite size pieces for guests to enjoy.

Kabobs that alternate meat with vegetables are ideal options too. If you\u2019re going for a more casual shower and the guest of honor is a fan, you might even consider barbecuing some ribs.  Any grilled meat dish can be simple but delicious if you find the right marinade. Search online for some recipes that the guest(s) of honor is sure to enjoy.

Grilled vegetable skewers are usually the easiest way to go, but you can also grill whole portobello mushrooms to serve as \u201csteaks.\u201d Tofu steaks are another option.

Visit your local grocery store or deli to purchase premade sides that are traditionally served at  barbecues, such as coleslaw, potato salad, or pasta salad, so you don\u2019t have to worry about making them yourself.  If you want to make the side dishes yourself, prepare them the day before so you don\u2019t have to worry about finishing them when you\u2019re manning the grill.

If you want the guests to mix their own cocktails, make sure to print out instructions and leave them at the drink station where they\u2019re easily accessible. You can get the best of both worlds by making an Arnold Palmer, which is a mixture of lemonade and iced tea, and adding your favorite spirit, such as bourbon or vodka.

Some activities will not require reservations, such as going to a water park or playing mini golf, but golf, camping, snorkeling, paintballing, going to nightclubs and most other activities require reservations for large groups.  ", " Plan for food. Decide when and where you\u2019re going to be eating dinner, and if the party is going to last for more than a day or two where you\u2019ll get breakfast and lunch. Decide if you\u2019re going to eat out or hire a catering company.  Plan food according to your activities and where you\u2019re going to be staying so you have time to do everything. Check if anyone in the group has food allergies or special diet requirements before booking so you can accommodate them.  ", " Plan for alcohol. Figure out how much and what kinds of alcohol you need to order in advance and how much you expect to buy at restaurants, clubs and bars, or during activities. Make sure you and others are going to be able to pay in cash or by card for the planned drinks when you get there. Decide if you need a catering company for drinks.  Decide how much beer, wine and spirits you\u2019ll be getting, and the amount of cocktail mixers you\u2019ll need. Check if there\u2019s anyone in your group who isn\u2019t drinking so that you can provide alternatives like soda for them.  "], "Making Sure Everyone Has Fun": [" Keep everything well organized. Stay in control by not having too much to drink, and make sure you know where all the members of the party are. It\u2019s your job to make sure no one gets lost, and that meals, activities and drinks have been paid for before you leave a place.  Keep a copy of bookings for activities and restaurants on your phone or as a printout to make sure there are no problems, and you\u2019re not confused about where you\u2019re going next.  ", " Communicate well. Speak with the groomsmen, friends and relations at the party and make sure that everyone is happy and having a good time. Help people or groups who don\u2019t know each other start conversations and get on.  Do rounds of the party at each activity and place you visit as a way to check in with everyone frequently.  ", " Stay safe. Ensure nobody drives when the party has been drinking, and that party members don\u2019t wander off alone in nightclubs, city streets or other potentially dangerous areas.  A good way to do this is to have a buddy system \u2013 everyone in the group should pair up with someone else, that way if anyone goes missing it will be immediately obvious who it is. Check where the potentially dangerous areas in the city you\u2019re visiting are so that you don\u2019t end up there by accident. These could include places where gangs spend time or even buffet restaurants with a terrible reputation.  ", " Handle problems. Take care of any mishaps, arguments or accidents. Make sure you pay attention to party members who\u2019ve had too much to drink or feel ill from food, travel or activities. If they need to go back to the hotel or home, make sure they get there safely by checking their transport options and calling or booking it for them.  Other problems could include sorting out transport if you end up in the wrong place, cancelling credit cards if someone loses their wallet, calming down an argument in a nightclub, helping someone who gets injured during an activity, and stopping drunk people getting tattoos. Know the phone numbers of hotel concierge, local limo and cab companies, and emergency services in case of an accident.  ", " Pay attention to the groom. He may have last minute requests for you at the party, or he may need your help to avoid situations he thinks are inappropriate.

"]}}, "How to Throw an Engagement Party": {"description": "An engagement party is a once-in-a-lifetime event to celebrate a couple's plans to marry. It is the opportunity for people to congratulate you and introduce the bride and groom\u2019s friends and families to one another. Throwing the engagement party can be a lot of time and effort but if you follow a few steps and keep organized then you should have a blast!", "content": {"Planning and Budgeting for the Party": [" Agree on a host. Traditionally the parents of either the groom or the bride will host the engagement party, but it is also common for the couple themselves to host the party. Other options include a friend of the couple, both families co-hosting the party or even the groom planning the celebration. Since it is not always customary to have an engagement party, the couple may not even know that there is interest in giving them one. It also isn't the type of party that a couple could ask someone to do for them, so letting them know you are interested in throwing the party will open the door for them to talk to you about what type of party they are interested in. This will help you to get a tentative guest list from them. While the best man or maid of honor can throw the engagement party, it is usually better for the families or the couple themselves to throw the party since the maid of honor and best man will have to organize other parties later on. If the couple is announcing their engagement for the first time, then they likely will host the event.   ", " Pick a date and time. The engagement party is usually held one to three months after the proposal but this will depend on the individual circumstances of the bride and groom. If the couple plans to have a short engagement then the party should be sooner rather than later. If it is too close to the time of the wedding then it can feel like an early wedding shower and this is not what you want. Nine to eleven months before the wedding is a good time for the engagement party. Holding the party on a weekday rather than a weekend can significantly reduce the cost of the celebration.  While many parties are held in the evening, the engagement party could also be a breakfast or brunch event, a mid-day pool party or held during happy hour at your favorite bar. Be creative.  ", " Determine a budget. The engagement party does not have to be costly. It should be a fun and happy celebration so it can be as relaxed or high-energy as you choose. Some prefer to hold just a small get-together while others prefer to hold an evening filled with dancing and music. A formal dinner party would be more expensive than a backyard barbecue but either are acceptable for an engagement party. Set a budget that includes all aspects of the party: invitations, food, drink, entertainment, decoration, venue and favors.  ", " Create a guest list. The purpose of the engagement party is to bring together the bride and groom\u2019s friends and family so that they can all meet one another. The engagement party is usually an intimate occasion and it is usually inappropriate to invite anyone who will not be invited to the wedding. Get lists from the bride and groom of close family and friends. If you are on a tight budget, reduce the guest list by inviting only immediate family members and close friends. Sometimes you can invite people to the engagement party that are not invited to the wedding. This is especially true nowadays when many couples live and/or host their weddings far from friends and families. If the engagement party is going to be a surprise, make a guest list including the family members and close friends. Ask two or three other people to review the list to make sure you don\u2019t forget anyone.  ", " Determine a venue. The venue can be anything you choose: your own home, a park, the beach, a restaurant, a hall or a bar for example. Remember your budget and the theme of your party when deciding on a venue. Consider having the party at a place that is special to the couple. For example the location of their first date, a park they enjoy going to or some other location.  ", " Decide whether or not you will be accepting gifts. Gifts can be a source of confusion for guests and it is important to inform people ahead of time if gifts are accepted or not. Many do not accept gifts at their engagement party and the invitations should read \u201cno gifts please\u201d to clarify this fact. If you do choose to accept gifts then you should expect low- to mid-range priced gifts and can register for these. The location of registration should be marked on the invitations in this case. If you have requested no gifts yet guests bring them, wait until after the party to open them so that other guests do not feel uncomfortable.  ", " Find others to help you organize the party. Throwing a party can be a lot of work so try to find a few other people in the planning and preparation. If you already know the members of the wedding party then you can involve them in the engagement party. ", " Send invitations. These should be sent out around one month to six weeks before the party. Invitations can be elaborate but it is also perfectly acceptable to send email or another kind of electronic invitation. This will also reduce the cost of the party. They should be kept with the theme of the party. Invitations should be sent out four to six weeks before the party. The invitations do not have to match the rest of your stationary, especially if you have not decided on a theme or color palette yet. You can include a return card for RSVPs or not depending on your preference.  ", " Decide on party favors. It is not necessary to provide party favors but if you do want to then you can choose something small like baked goods or treats. You may also choose to give a small gift to your wedding party to show your appreciation. ", " Create a back-up if you plan to have the party outdoors. If you choose an outdoor location like the beach or a park for the party, make sure you have a back-up plan if the weather does not agree. You do not want to wake up to rain and have nowhere to host the party! ", " Go shopping in the week before the party if necessary. If you are hosting the party at your home or another outdoor location, make sure you give yourself enough time to buy the food, drinks and any other goods you might need such as plates and cups. ", " Prepare the venue. Ensure that there are places for the guests to sit and eat. If the party is hosted at a private residence then make sure the yard is tended to, the house cleaned and that the AC/heating system is working.  If you are accepting gifts, make sure there is an area to put them.  ", " Make sure there is space for vehicles to park. Depending on the size of the party and the venue you may need to arrange special parking areas. Make sure there is space for the guests to park their vehicles to avoid traffic jams. "], "Handling Food and Entertainment": [" Decide on a theme. Pick a theme that excites you and makes you want to party and have fun. The theme can go along with the theme of the wedding (if you know it already) or it can be different. The engagement party is meant to be fun so choose a theme that means something to the couple or reflects the two families being joined together. An example is a manga-inspired party for a couple who share a love of anime. If you plan a low-key wedding then you do not want your engagement party to upstage your wedding. Keep it low-key as well. Even if you plan a laid-back engagement party, having a theme and coordinating color palette can help keep things together.  ", " Decide on decorations and centerpieces. Keep the decorations simple such as streamers and balloons. Photo boards of the couple are also great decorations and a fun way to show off the couple. Flowers are great centerpieces and can be as simple as a sunflower or hydrangea. If you have a theme then you can tailor the decorations according to the theme.  ", " Plan a menu. Whether you will host the party at a restaurant or private home, you can plan a menu according to the theme and preferences of the couple and their families. Be careful of any allergies or food specifications of your guests. ", " Choose a cake or other dessert. You do not have to have a cake but if you do want one, putting a picture of the proposal on the cake can be a great idea. Alternatives include ice cream sandwiches, assorted baked goods or seasonal treats like candy apples or cotton candy.  ", " Decide on the entertainment. Most engagement parties will have music and this can come from either a playlist you create on your computer or hiring a DJ for a few hours. The entertainment does not have to be expensive or extravagant; remember that the party is meant to introduce your families and friends together so they should be able to talk to one another. You could also hire alternative entertainment such as a slideshow or video of the proposal, magicians, circus performers, or live music. Better yet, you can host the party in a location that already has such entertainment.  ", " Prepare a few games to play. A fun idea would be to prepare a few games to play. The games should be fun, simple and get everyone involved. For example, you could hold a \u201cteam scavenger hunt\u201d to get the two families acquainted. ", " Create a song list for the party. If you are not having a DJ, which isn\u2019t necessary, create a playlist of songs to play during the party. Think about what people might like to dance to, or what would be most fun for the party. You can also include songs important to the couple. ", " Ask for marriage advice from guests. Ask for marriage/relationship advice from the guests. Leave out a book for all the guests to write their advice in. This is a nice keepsake for the couple to read through after the party. "], "Hosting the Party": [" Get plenty of rest before the party. Throwing a party takes a lot of energy and work. Make sure you get enough sleep the whole week before the party- you want to be able to enjoy the party once it happens!  ", " Introduce guests to one another. The engagement party is an opportunity for friends and family from both the bride and groom\u2019s side to meet one another. Make sure you introduce people to one another to help people mingle and interact. Don\u2019t let forgetting someone\u2019s name prevent you from introducing the guest. Just politely ask for their name and apologize for forgetting. It is better to ask then to not introduce the guest.  ", " Create space for an informal receiving line near the front door. Everyone will want to greet the lucky couple and give them their congratulations. Make a little space near the entryway so that everyone can have their time to speak to the couple. ", " Take lots of photos. As the host you may be very busy organizing things at the party so ask someone else to take photos for you. Alternatively you can ask all the guests to take pictures and post them on social media using the same hashtag so that you can download and share them. Another idea is to leave out disposable cameras for all the guests to take pictures with. If you have the budget, hire a professional photographer to take pictures during the event.  ", " Share stories about the couple. When everyone is happily eating food and have had a chance to mingle a bit, ask for stories about the couple. These stories can be funny, romantic or surprising. Even the couple can share a few stories, for example how they met or the proposal story. ", " Be prepared to give a toast. As the host you would usually be expected to welcome everyone and give a toast to the couple. Others may also be interested in making a toast so try to find out ahead of time if others would like to do so. It is traditional that the father of the bride gives a toast although this is not required.  ", " Be able to conclude any uncomfortable or negative remarks or long-winded speeches. Some people may make inappropriate remarks about the couple, exes or other topics. Similarly if someone is making a very long speech then you should be prepared to encourage them to finish. Prepare a few alternative topics or conversation starters to avoid these situations. ", " Enjoy the party! The most important part is to enjoy the party. An engagement party should be a happy and fun celebration of the couple beginning their wedding preparations together. Make sure you have energy and are not too stressed to have fun during the party.

Avoid involving the bride in the planning details, but do check in early on to make sure that her party is what she wants, whether that\u2019s a relaxed dinner out or the stereotypical, raunchy bash. Ask her what she expects and feels comfortable with.   ", " Set a date for the party a few months in advance. Consult the bride, unless you\u2019re planning a surprise party. Decide whether it will be just one night or a weekend-long affair. About a month before the wedding date is a good timeframe to aim for, but work around the bride\u2019s availability.  ", " Make a guest list with the bride. Unless she specifically delegates this job to just you, ask her who she wants to invite. Give her suggestions but defer to her judgment if she feels strongly about inviting someone or not.  The amount of guests will have a big impact on the feel of the party. A smaller group will be more intimate and easier to keep together, while a larger one will feel more hectic but also potentially more exciting. It\u2019s a good idea to invite the bride\u2019s future sisters-in-law, even if they\u2019re not very close. Consider inviting the bride\u2019s and/or groom\u2019s mother, depending on their relationship to the bride and the feel of the party.  Avoid inviting anyone who\u2019s not invited to the actual wedding.   "], "Deciding on Budget and Location": [" Budget carefully for the party. You and the guests will all be sharing the cost, since the bride typically doesn\u2019t pay for anything (it\u2019s her party, after all!). This means you\u2019ll be splitting costs for a hotel, food, drinks, decorations, and anything else you might want. If the guests are younger and not financially stable, you probably won\u2019t want to make them foot a $1,000 bill.  Reach out out to some of the other guests or bridesmaids to get their opinion if you\u2019re concerned about setting a fair budget.  ", " Set a location. Find out where your guests live and what will be most convenient for the majority, as well as what the bride would like. A weekend in Vegas might be inconvenient and expensive if most of the guests live on the East Coast or abroad, but New York City or New Orleans might work. If your guests are spread out across the country or world, try to choose someplace in the middle. You may not be able to pick somewhere convenient for everyone and still fun for the bride, so invite far-flung friends to Skype in or send gifts or activity suggestions to keep them included.  Consider a \u201cstaycation\u201d if most guests are local. Renting a couple of rooms in a hotel or Airbnb makes it easy for guests to leave if they don\u2019t want to stay the night or have other commitments that weekend.  ", " Send invitations as soon as the date and location are confirmed. Request that guests RSVP as soon as possible and send you an email or text if they have any questions. E-vites are a good option for younger guests.  Include details the guests may need to know. Is it a surprise party? Is there a suggested  dress code? Should they bring gifts? Mention the tentative cost per person, but remind guests that it might change based on the final headcount.   "], "Choosing Party Activities and Confirming Details": [" Choose activities for the party. Decide on this at least two months in advance so you can start planning the smaller details. Take into account the preferences of the bride and guests. While a night on the town can be fun, you can also consider a wine-tasting event, karaoke, a sports game or a weekend cruise. Scavenger hunts or picnics are family-friendly options for parties that include older guests or guests with kids.  Ask the other bridesmaids for their ideas. You may not end up using any of them, but you\u2019ll avoid drama if everyone feels like their voice has been heard. Set a weeklong window for their contributions so that you don\u2019t have ideas trickling in too late.  If you\u2019ll be catering or making food, make sure to check with guests for food allergies.  ", " Map out a timeline for the night or weekend of the party. Ask guests when they\u2019re arriving and if they have transportation from the airport. Decide on a time for dinner or cocktail hour, or approximately when you should head from the first winery to the second. Your plans may change during the night, but having a schedule rules out the possibility of awkward downtime.  ", " Set up transportation at least a month before the party. Pay particular attention to this detail if the group will be drinking alcohol. Call for bus or limo rates for a larger group, or plan to split Ubers throughout the night. Even if alcohol won\u2019t be served, a bus will make it easier to keep together a bigger group. ", " Buy decorations if the party is themed or hosted at a house. Stick to your budget and look in party stores and online for the best deals. Start looking at least a month in advance so you\u2019ll have plenty of time in case anything is out of stock or being shipped. Buy the bride a fun wedding-themed accessory, like a tiara or a fake veil. The guests may also want something to make them stand out from the crowd, like matching shirts or feather boas.

You can also have a more formal seating arrangement for a dinner or one that promotes mingling for appetizers.   ", " Look at a reception hall. If you want one-stop shopping where you can find in-house catering, bartenders, and waitstaff, go for a venue that\u2019s known for receptions.
