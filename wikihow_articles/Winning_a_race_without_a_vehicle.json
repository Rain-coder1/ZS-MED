Keep an even, natural pace. Don't worry, you'll soon pass the others who used up all their energy with the first lap.   You see, an 800 meter dash is a pure mix of stamina and speed. You need both if you want to succeed. During the first lap, keep a steady and even pace. Not to fast, but definitely not to slow. When you reach your second lap, pick up the pace about 30%. And when you get to the last 200 meters, push yourself forward and use up any energy you have left. Don't spare one drop.

Rock your pelvis forward, make sure your wrists are cocked to make yourself more springy, and focus on really driving that knee forward to compensate. (When on the final sprint focus on your arms and not your legs. Pump your arms faster and your legs will follow. Trust your legs to know how to keep moving.) If you want to decelerate, do so, but most of the time, the person who wins is the one who slows least. Pick your lane, and just continue driving until you crossed the finish line.

Ladder workouts are versatile, can be done on treadmills, roads, trails, or tracks.  An example of a ladder workout is running slightly faster than your target pace for 1 minute, then jog at an easy pace for 1 minute. Next, run slightly faster than your target pace for 2 minutes, then jog at an easy pace for 2 minutes. Repeat this up to 4 minutes, and then work your way back down the \"ladder\", ending with 1 minute again.  ", " Taper down your runs in the lead up to the race. Tapering is when you decrease the frequency and duration of your training runs as you approach a race. This helps your body to recuperate and be ready to go on race day.  Taper by exponentially reducing your weekly mileage for 1 - 2 weeks before the race. Also reduce the number of intervals and duration you are doing during your training.  Although it can feel wrong to stop training as much as race day comes closer, don\u2019t replace the absent runs with other forms of exercise, as this time is necessary for your body to rebuild.  "], "Eating and Drinking for the Race": [" Eat a consistent, nutritious, carbohydrate-rich diet during training. Running requires a lot of energy from food, and eating enough will mean that you can run to the best of your ability, without feeling faint or too tired. Complex carbohydrates such as whole-wheat pasta, whole-grain bread, vegetables, and brown rice are all ideal for runners.  A ratio of 4:1 carbohydrates to proteins is generally recommended for runners. Within 1 hour after each run, make sure that you refuel with a carbohydrate and protein rich snack. Some options are a piece of whole-grain toast with peanut butter, or some yogurt with fruit. If you are having trouble feeling fueled for running, book an appointment with a sports nutritionist or dietician, as they can give you tailored and specialized advice.  ", " Drink plenty of water throughout your training. Having an adequate amount of fluids throughout the training process will help your body to perform to the best of its ability. Water is crucial for your muscles and brain to train and perform.  Although everybody requires a different amount of water, 60 oz.(1.7 L) of water daily tends to work well for most people. For every cup of coffee, soda, or alcohol that you drink, match it with a glass of water. Your urine is the best indicator for how well hydrated you are. The more dehydrated you are, the darker it will be, so aim for light yellow.  ", " Find out the type and brand of sports drink which will be provided. Most races offer a sports drink to runners, and many larger races are sponsored by a particular brand of sports drink. If possible, incorporate this drink into your training so that you can make the most of it on race day.  Don\u2019t drink the featured drink if it wasn\u2019t part of your training. Each drink has differing levels of carbohydrates, proteins, and electrolytes. Suddenly introducing these to your system on the race day can cause digestion issues.  ", " Eat plenty of complex carbohydrates 3 days before the race. Meals such as a tomato based pasta dish, or peanut butter sandwiches using whole-grain bread are ideal. A good proportion to follow is 70% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 10% protein.  Carbohydrates give both your brain and muscles the energy and nutrients that they need to run the race most efficiently. For more variety of complex carbohydrates, try oatmeal or tabbouleh too.  ", " Consume simple carbohydrates 2 days before race. Fruit, white pasta, or white bread are good options during this time. Avoid simple carbohydrates which are high in saturated fat, such as cookies or doughnuts, as they can slow down your digestion.  If you haven\u2019t eaten much fruit throughout your training, now is not the best time to start. All of the extra fiber from the fruit could hinder your digestion.  ", " Stick to easily digestible, simple carbohydrates on the day before. Foods that have worked well for you during your training, and which don\u2019t make your digestion feel sluggish will work best during this time. Ideally, have your last big meal 12 - 15 hours before the race start time..  White pasta with a simple marinara sauce usually works well the night before a race.  ", " Hydrate the day before the race without overdoing it. Drink water whenever you are thirsty, and with every meal the day before the race. Avoid drinking too much water on the day before the race.  Each hour, drinking 4 - 8 oz. (0.1 - 0.2 L) is a good amount to aim for. Make sure that you eat some salty carbohydrates on the day before the race, such as pretzels, to make sure that your body isn\u2019t flushing out electrolytes that you will need for the race.  ", " Have a light breakfast before the race begins. A meal 3 hours before the race starts helps to slightly replenish your energy stores that you have built up over the previous few days, without feeling too heavy. Some light suggestions are cereal or oatmeal with low-fat milk, or half a bagel with low-fat yogurt.  These are general guidelines, and sticking with what has worked for you before running in the past is best. Never experiment with new foods on the morning of the race. Although coffee isn\u2019t generally recommended before a race as it can harm your digestion, if a cup of coffee is part of your daily habit then definitely include it on race morning too.  ", " Drink 16 oz (0.5 L) of water two hours before the race begins. Drink water on the morning of the race to ensure that you are well hydrated for the running ahead. Don\u2019t drink water too close to the start time however, as the water needs some time to pass into your system and properly hydrate you. "], "Preparing Mentally": [" Sleep for 8 - 10 hours per night during training. Sleep is a vital part of running training as it allows your body to rest and recuperate from the difficult workouts. It also helps you to feel mentally fresh and prepared.  If you have trouble sleeping the night before the race due to excitement or nerves, having this consistent sleep schedule will help your body to cope well without any adverse effects.  ", " Choose a mantra for your runs. Having a mantra that you can rely on will help you to keeping going when running is tough. This will be especially useful on race day as you face hills or difficult stretches.  A mantra is both something to focus on, and something to help you keep going. Repeat the mantra in your head calmly and steadily, to create a rhythm for your pace or for your breathing. A useful mantra for strength is \u201cRun strong. Be brave.\u201d A mantra for enduring the tough times is \u201cThe pain of discipline or the pain of regret.\u201d  ", " Form a race plan for your race. A race plan determines what your target pace is for each part of the race. A race plan helps to make your running consistent, and means that there aren\u2019t any surprises on race day.  Check the elevation and terrain of the course before making a race plan so that it can be as accurate as possible. Race plans generally start off patiently and conservatively during the beginning, and focus on speed during the final mile.  ", " Get a good sleep the night before the race. This will help you to feel well-rested and prepared on the morning of the race. If you can\u2019t sleep for this long however, whether this is due to nerves or an early start, don\u2019t worry as having a consistent sleeping pattern during your training will help to balance any negative effects.  If possible, don\u2019t go to bed too early, otherwise you may wake up too early on the race morning and not be able to get back to sleep.  "], "Sorting Out the Details for Race Day": [" Pick up your race pack as early as possible. Race packs are usually available to be picked up the day before the race. This will help you to feel calm, collected, and prepared, rather than feeling rushed and stressed trying to pick up your race pack at the last minute.  Picking up your race pack early means that you are also more likely to get a t-shirt size that fits you best. Race packs are often picked up from a health and sports expo. Take part in the expo, but try not to walk around too much. You need to save your energy for race day. Also don\u2019t use anything that you purchase at the expo on the day of the race. Save it for your future training and races.  You can pick up your bib on the day for many smaller races. See you race details or contact the organisers if you are unsure.  ", " Lay out your clothes and gear for the race the night before. This will help you to feel prepared and ready on the morning of the race, and will help you to avoid misplacing any gear. Stick to gear that you have trained in, as your body and running style will be used to it, and will run best in it.  Dress for 15\u00b0F (9\u00b0C) warmer than it actually is, as it will feel as though your body is heating up by this much anyway. This will help you to wear clothes that are a comfortable temperature during the race. The gear which you will need to lay out the night before are short, top, race bib, socks, shoes, hydration belt (if you are using one), ID, car keys, and anything else you will need on the day of the race. Pin your race bib to the front of your top, using a safety pin in each corner to secure it. If there is a timing device on the back, make sure that it isn't bent in any way.   ", " Finalize the logistics for the race day. Make sure that you double check the start time of the race, and how you will get there. Also check where you can park, and if any roads on your route will be closed due to the race. Having all of the logistics sorted before the day of the race will help you to feel calm and confident on the day. Studying the race course map is also an important aspect of the logistics. All races will provide a map outlining the race that you will run on the day. Many of these include where the bathrooms are, where food and fluids are provided, and where the first aid station is. The course map will also show the distances and elevations that will occur during the race.  If you live near the course and are allowed access to it, go for a walk to get a feel for it beforehand.  ", " Check the weather for the race day in advance. If the forecast is warm and sunny, make sure you plan to have a hat and sunblock with you. If the weather looks like it will be wet and cold, make sure you wear layers and bring along a warm blanket for afterwards.  Make sure that you have practised running with a shorter stride and watching your steps, if you think that the ground might be icy on the day.  ", " Arrive at the race venue at least 1 hour early. This gives you enough time to find a carpark, pick up your race pack if you haven\u2019t already, and to use the bathroom. It\u2019s better to have too much time rather than too little, and this will help you to feel relaxed before the race.  ", " Use the bathroom at the race venue. Digestion issues are common with running, so make sure you use the bathroom before the race to avoid feeling uncomfortable during the race. The lines for the bathroom might be long, so make sure that you have enough time to spare.  Many longer races have bathrooms located along the route.  ", " Warm up with by jogging for about 10-15 minutes. Warming up is essential for getting your muscles ready to run efficiently, as you want to begin the race ready to run your best. A quick walk and light jog sequence will warm you up well.  If it\u2019s cold out, you may want to spend a little longer warming up. Doing your regular pre-running stretches during this time will also help your muscles to stretch and warm up. Even if you\u2019re feeling very warm, try your best to keep pants and a shirt on over your racing outfit while you\u2019re warming up. It\u2019s actually ideal to be sweating a little when you shed your outerwear and get on the starting line.  ", " Head to the start line 15 minutes before your start time. Make sure that you have plenty of time to spare, and that you don\u2019t feel rushed or stressed before the race, and this could harm your running. Having enough time to take in your surroundings and your fellow athletes will also help. This is a great time to do dynamic stretches and stride-outs to finish warming up.

If you run regularly or are just starting out, your needs are the same: comfortable clothes in the right material, appropriate shoes, and dressing for the weather. There are not many differences between the clothes you regularly run in and race-day clothes, but a few tips can make your race more comfortable, and hopefully make you more competitive!", "content": {"Getting Your Basic Gear": [" Invest in lightweight, technical clothing. When you race, your clothes should not weigh you down or restrict your movement. Technical running clothes are the most lightweight and least restrictive. Technical clothing will also wick sweat away from your body, so it stays light and dry.  You can get shorts, long and short sleeve t-shirts, pants, tights, running skirts, bras, jackets, socks, hats, and gloves in these materials. Avoid running races in cotton clothes. These can get heavy and damp with sweat and rain.    ", " Find a supportive sports bra. A supportive bra will limit the movement of your breasts. This will help you run more comfortably. It will also prevent stretching of the Cooper\u2019s ligament, which causes your breasts to droop. Your bra should cover your entire breast and hold it firmly in place.  Sports bras come with a shelf that holds both breasts or with cups that hold each breast separately. Cups are more supportive. Racerback bras provide strong support because they pull the bra close to your body. Find a smaller bra if the band pulls away from your body or if it rides up when you lift your arms. If the band rides up in the back, the bra is too small.  ", " Opt for running socks. Running socks are a good choice for racing. These socks do not have seams, which can cause blisters. Some running socks have double layers that can also prevent blisters. Others have padding on the soles for comfort. Socks with double layers might shrink significantly in the wash. Padded socks can get very warm. You can find very thin running socks in technical materials to help you avoid sweaty feet.  ", " Stay cool in the heat. You should wear minimal clothing in hot weather. Shorts and a short sleeve t-shirt or tank top are the basic clothes for hotter temperatures. Men can wear light-weight shorts that have a built-in brief. For women who want to cover more, there are running skirts and capri-length tights.  You may chafe more in hotter weather. Wear longer shorts or a sports bra with wider sides to prevent chafing.  ", " Layer in the cold. Dress in layers for races in cold weather. Thin layers are better than one heavy layer because heat will stay trapped between layers. You will warm up as you run, so dress for slightly warmer weather. You can also remove layers as your body heats up.  Start with a warm base of snug-fitting tights and a fitted long sleeve t-shirt. The next most basic layer is a shell or jacket. If it is windy, add a layer of wind-resistant pants. In freezing temperatures, wear a hat or thick headband, gloves, and neck warmer or balaclava.  Cover exposed areas with Vaseline to avoid frostbite. Layer your socks.  ", " Race comfortably in the rain. You can race comfortably in the rain with a few good wardrobe choices. Choose lightweight technical clothes that will not get heavy from sweat and rainwater. Wearing tighter clothes will help prevent your wet skin from chafing. Just make sure your clothes are not too tight or you may chafe even more. Wear a visor or baseball cap to keep water out of your eyes. Bring an unused trash bag with you and then cut holes in the bottom and sides. You can wear the trash bag like a poncho and it will help to keep you dry. Wear your thinnest technical socks so they don\u2019t become heavy with rainwater.  "], "Choosing Running Shoes": [" Get the right fit. You want to make sure that your shoes fit properly and are comfortable. This will prevent injuries and blisters. Try on several pairs and run around the store to test the fit. Some specialty stores will even let you test them outside.  Be flexible about sizing. Shoes sizes can vary between manufacturers or even between models made by the same company. Your feet swell when you run, so try on shoes at the end of the day when your feet are more swollen.  Find shoes with a little space in the toe box, so they do not rub and form blisters or black toenails.  Heels and laces should fit snuggly, but neither should be tight.  ", " Choose a supportive shoe. The way your foot falls when you run can tell you how much support you need from your shoe. If your foot falls inward, choose a supportive shoe. This will help stabilize your body and can prevent knee pain and injury.  You can tell that your foot falls inward when you run if your arches and the insides of your knees tilt inward when you bend your knees. A firmer midsole provides more support.  ", " Look for a flexible shoe. If your foot rolls outward when you run, your weight is concentrated on the outside of your foot. This means your foot does not receive much natural cushioning when it hits the ground. Find a shoe with a very cushiony, flexible sole that will balance your weight.  The soles of your shoes will show more wear at the outside of the foot if your foot turns outward when you run.  ", " Find a shoe that can absorb impact. When you run, you land on your feet with a force greater than your body weight. This can make your legs tired and lead to injuries. Run in a shoe with extra cushioning in the sole.  Be sure that the shoe allows easy flexing in the ball of your foot. Super cushioned shoes provide more shock absorption.  ", " Select your shoe based on the type of race. You should also select your shoes based on the types of races you run. If you run on trails or in slick conditions, find a shoe with more traction. Look for a shoe with a highly breathable mesh upper if you run in the heat. In a rainy climate, you might prefer waterproof shoes. ", " Break them in. Do not run a race in new shoes. On race day you want to be sure that your shoes are comfortable and properly supportive. If you plan to buy a new pair of shoes for the race, run in them for a few weeks before the race. You will want to break them in even if the new shoes are a model you have raced in before.  "], "Accessorizing for Your Race": [" Grab your water bottle. Run with a water bottle to stay hydrated during your race. This is important in any kind of weather. Water bottles with hand-straps, runners\u2019 belts with water bottles, and CamelBaks are designed to make carrying your water easier.  You can also place water bottles along your route. Most races have stations where runners can grab a cup of water, but you may want to check in advance to be sure. If the race does not have water stations, then you will need to bring your own water for the race.  ", " Secure your hair. Hair that flies around can be distracting during a race. Headbands, ponytails, and clips keep hair off of your face and out of your eyes. For longer hair, find a ponytail holder or braid style that will keep your hair in place.  Keeping hair out of your eyes helps with your visibility. A ponytail or braid also keeps long hair off of your neck, which can get uncomfortable and sweaty. A slipping ponytail or braid can be a distraction. If your hair is long and the ponytail is heavy, then this may also lead to problems, such as neck strain. Make sure your hair is comfortable and will stay in place.  ", " Take your technology. Runners accessorize with all kinds of electronic gear. Headphones and watches are common gear for races. The best headphones for running are waterproof, light, and comfortable, with a secure fit. Watches help runners keep track of time, show different splits for intervals, and can even come with GPS.  All of the technology you race with should be lightweight and comfortable so it does not distract you.  ", " Apply sunscreen. When you are running outdoors, it is important to protect your skin from the sun. Make sure to apply an SPF 30 or higher water resistant sunscreen about 15 to 20 minutes before the race begins. Apply the sunscreen to any areas of your skin that will be exposed to the sun. This will help to protect you from getting a sunburn while you are running. Use a lip balm with SPF protection as well.

It truly is an art form, and getting great at it will take time \u2013 but it may pay off.", "content": {"Decoding the Racing Form": [" Hone your handicapping skills. Handicapping is the process of determining which horse has the best chance to win a race. It is a test of your creative intelligence, not systematic computation. To do this, you\u2019ll need the Daily Racing Form, which you can buy upon entering the track. The DRF is full of a whole bunch of stats and figures, which we\u2019ll be discussing below. Once you know how to decode the racing form, you\u2019ll have a pretty good idea of which horses will (or at least ) do well.   ", " Look at the Beyer Speed Figures. Beyer numbers often serve as a starting point in the handicapping process. They are the bold numbers found in the middle of each DRF, indicating the horse's past performances. Handicappers often use the horse with the highest last-race Beyer as their focus and eliminate horses that have never run a figure close to this horse's figure. There are two numbers: pace and speed.  . By scanning the past performances, handicappers try to estimate the pace of the current race and determine which horse will benefit most from it. The first bold-face number, pace, shows whether the horse likes to be on the early lead or not.  This is not the same as pace. Speed (the 2nd bold-faced number) shows the horse\u2019s ability to pass other less-speedy horses as they near the finish line. Speed does not equal consistency (which pace can).

If you\u2019re looking at a horse that tires out around six furlongs and you\u2019re at the Belmont Stakes where it\u2019s a whopping furlongs, you probably don\u2019t want to bet that horse. How has your horse run in other races of this similar length? Distance, pace, and speed are very powerful in tandem. Looking at how your horse runs (and, as importantly, how she finishes) in different distances will clue you in to how she\u2019ll perform in races of different lengths.  ", " Take into account the track and the weather. This is called \u201ctrack bias\u201d: no single factor in handicapping can change the complexion of a race like a track bias. If wise bettors detect any kind of bias in the racing surface, they incorporate it into their decision-making. What is track bias? Every horse has their preferred surface, whether it\u2019s turf or dirt. You want to know how your horse will perform on whatever your track is. Don\u2019t forget the weather! A little rain quickly turns that dirt into mud. Take into account how your horse has performed in this type of weather, not just the type of track.  ", " Consider \u201cform cycles. \u201d Handicappers must ask themselves questions about each horse. Is her last race a true representation of her ability? Is she likely to improve or regress on race day? Which horses raced against a bias last out and can be expected to offer a peak performance today? Horses, just like humans, are never 100% consistent. One thing to consider is the size of the purse and where the horse is coming from. If the size of the purse is large, this is one classy horse \u2013 she\u2019ll probably be pretty consistent (she didn\u2019t get to the big leagues for nothing). And if she got flown in from somewhere, her owners paid a pretty penny to get her there, so they\u2019ll probably break out all the stops to see her win.  ", " Look at the horse\u2019s post position. In the list of the horse\u2019s previous races, you\u2019ll see her previous post position. Sprint races around one turn usually favor outside posts, while route races (races with 2 turns) at longer distances often favor inside post positions. What\u2019s this race? And what is your horse\u2019s post position? Has she run a race like this in the past and done well? You may want to consider other horse's post positions, too. If a certain horse seems to be speedier on the inside and for this race is on the inside, this horse will be serious competition.  "], "Placing Your Bets": [" Get familiar with your track, the tracks being simulcast, and get your papers. With your umbrella and binoculars in hand, get going to your track. Step out onto the track before the races begin \u2013 what\u2019s it like? Find the bettor\u2019s window, and sit down to read your DRF. There are a few other pieces you can get for purchase, too:  \u2019\u2019A racetrack program.\u2019\u2019 This has information on all the horses, jockeys, trainers, and owners. The cost is usually $3. \u2019\u2019Public handicapper selections.\u2019\u2019: If your racetrack or OTB (off-track betting) is covered by the local newspaper, they may pay a handicapper to make daily horse selections. The cost is usually 50 cents. \u2019\u2019Handicapping tip sheets.\u2019\u2019 These are daily selections published by handicappers at the racetrack. The cost is usually $2.  Tracks often simulcast from other tracks, too. This means you can watch the races live in one track and watch \u2018\u2019and bet on\u2019\u2019 races at other tracks being simulcast on TV. Imagine the bank you\u2019d make if you won both!  ", " Buy a Daily Racing Form. This form is the most important weapon in a handicapper's arsenal. It provides detailed information on each horse running in the day's races. It costs $4 at most race tracks and is outlined in the above section. At first glance, it\u2019s quite intimidating \u2013 but once you learn what all the numbers mean, it\u2019ll be your best friend.  Give yourself some extra time to sit down and study it. As you get better and better you'll need less and less time, but for now work at least a few races in advance. Being patient and doing your homework will increase your odds like little else.  ", " Familiarize yourself with different types of bets. When you go up to window, you need to know what you want! Here are your basic options: Show \u2013 your horse can get 1st, 2nd, or 3rd and you win Place \u2013 your horse can get 1st or 2nd and you win Win \u2013 your horse must get 1st to win Quinella \u2013 bet 2 or 3 horses to finish 1st or 2nd, in any order Exacta \u2013 bet 2 horses that must finish in 1st and 2nd in exact order Trifecta \u2013 bet 3 horses that must finish in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in exact order Superfecta \u2013 bet 4 horses that mush finish in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in exact order  ", " Know your odds and payouts. Let's say you bet $2 on a horse to win (which is the standard minimum bet). To determine how much you would win if she wins, take the odds of your horse and multiply the first number by 2 (your bet), then divide that by the second number, and then add $2 (again, your bet).  Let's say your horse has 3/1 odds. You multiple 3x2 to get $6. Divide that by 1, which is still $6. Then you add $2. You would make $8 on a $2 wager. Let's take a bet where lots of people are betting, like on a horse with 1/9 odds. You multiply 1x2 to get $2. Then 2/9, which is about 20 cents. Plus $2, and your winnings is $2.20.  ", " Consider each horse\u2019s individual characteristics. After you\u2019ve gotten down all the big numbers, you also want to look at other tidbits of information in the DRF. There\u2019s some information on there about each horse that can give them the edge to win. Consider: If a horse was recently claimed, or bought. If someone is willing to shovel out a chunk of change for a horse, they probably have potential. If there are any recent equipment changes. The owner is zeroing in on how to improve their horse's chances. Look at her workout speeds. Are they consistent? If she's running at the same speed every day, she's probably in top form. Consider the gender and breed. Generally speaking, males are faster than females. Only three fillies (females) have ever won the Kentucky Derby, for example. And better-bred horses will outperform others, too.  ", " Consider working out of two pockets. Any good bettor sometimes bets big and sometimes bets small. To keep yourself going and to keep from being bored between races you're very excited about, have a smaller pocket to work out of. You'll be $2 here, $2 there, and then when that big race comes up, you'll turn to your other pocket, and bet $20. Betting, quite frankly, in any arena, can be dangerous. It's always important to know when to stop. Having 2 separate pockets can help you keep your head above water, too.  ", " Place your bets at the window (and later collect your winnings). Remember this order: racetrack, race, dollar amount, bet type, horse number. So when you walk up to the window to talk to an actual human, this is the formula you follow. Here's an example: \"At Saratoga, I'd like to bet on the 5th race \u2013 a $4 exacta on horses 3 and 7.\" Make sure to do this the 5th race, of course. Check your ticket before you leave the window, just to make sure it's correct.  The racetrack is specified as many tracks are likely simulcast at the track you are currently in.  "], "Improving Your Game": [" Track your own records. Just like you would if you were playing poker, keep track of your own performance. Where do you seem to be making assumptions that aren't correct? What tidbits are you missing, resulting in betting on the wrong horse? What are you strong points? Knowing how you bet can help you overcome any personal weaknesses, too. When you go to the track, bring a pen and paper with you or a type of scorecard, just like avid fans of other sports do. Keep track of the results in addition to how you bet to jog your memory later. Establish what types of bets produce the highest returns for you and make them the focus of your wagering. Determine what types of races you have the most success with and which you can't decipher. If you conclude that you seldom pick winners on turf, avoid betting on grass races until you improve your handicapping.  ", " Read books on the subject. You don't have to depend all on your own ingenuity and ability to see outside the box \u2013 this is a very established field, so take advantage of it. Read reputable books about the art of horse racing. Knowing the strategy behind it like the back of the hand is one of the best things you can do for your odds. Of course, a lot of what's out there is just a giant scam to get your money. Research the author and preview the book before purchasing. Some people are out to make a dollar however they can.

They'll be full of tips and tricks, where you can meet other aficionados, too. To find this information, just inquire at your track. You're likely get put on an email list for their newsletter that will be full of the necessary information.  ", " Bet with friends. There's such a thing as a \"parlay bet\" and it can make betting on the horses even more fun. If you're with a group, get everyone to chip in, say, $5. Then, each person picks 1 horse to show on a certain race. Place the first bet, and then if you win, place the next bet including the winnings. If you hit a streak, that $5 can add up very quickly. Make sure the winnings (and the losses) get split evenly. Have everyone agree to a basic set of guidelines before participating in any betting. Some people may argue that they won while others lost \u2013 establish protocol before this happens.  ", " Become a high-roller in the National Thoroughbred Racing Association\u2019s annual National Handicapping Championship. Of course you have to qualify, but if you do you could win $1 million dollars. To get to this level, this basically has to be your job. But don't quit your day job just yet! Again, any type of gambling can be dangerous. Try to set yourself a limit \u2013 if you hit that point, you'll walk away. It's to easy to get into trouble in situations like this; always be looking out for yourself. Remain dispassionate when betting. Increasing the size and scope of your wagers to try to recoup losses often only results in more losses. Even the best horse players sometimes lose; they accept it as part of the game. What winning horse players don't do is wager recklessly when their emotions get in the way.
