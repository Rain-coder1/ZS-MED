Sewing elastic into a garment can be a little tricky, but there are 2 basic methods for doing so. You can sew the elastic to the garment directly or create a casing for the elastic and then insert the elastic through the casing. Sewing elastic directly into a garment may be best if you want the fabric to be gathered, and using a casing to sew elastic may be best if you want the fabric around the elastic to lay flat.", "content": {"Sewing Elastic Directly Into a Garment": [" Measure and cut the elastic. To determine how much elastic you will need for the band in your garment, measure the area of the person\u2019s body that the band will wrap around. This could be the person\u2019s waist, chest, upper arms, wrists, neck or another area that the garment will cover.  For example, if the elastic is part of a waistband, then measure around the person\u2019s waist. Use this measurement to figure out how much elastic you will need for the waistband, and cut the elastic to this length. If the person wants the elastic to fit snugly, then subtract some length from the measurement. For example, if the person wants a somewhat snug waistband, then subtract 2 inches (5.1\u00a0cm) to 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) from the waist measurement and cut the elastic to this length.

Use the zigzag stitch setting on your sewing machine and sew across the overlapping elastic 2 or 3 times. This will ensure that the ends of the elastic band are well connected.  Another option is to sew the ends of the elastic together using a scrap piece of fabric. Line up the edges of the elastic over the scrap piece of fabric and then sew a zigzag stitch across the edges 2 or 3 times. This will eliminate any bulging that may occur from overlapping the elastic.   ", " Pin the elastic to your fabric in 4 evenly spaced places. Start by pinning the seam of the elastic (the area you just sewed) to the seam on your fabric. If there is no seam in the fabric, then just choose any spot to place your first pin. Then, pin the opposite side of the elastic to the opposite side of the fabric band, and do the same for the two opposing sides of the elastic. Pinning the elastic this way will divide the elastic band and fabric into quarters and attach it evenly to 4 sections.  Make sure that the edge of the elastic is about 0.25 inches (0.64\u00a0cm) from the edge of the fabric. This will ensure that the elastic will be hidden when you sew the elastic in place.

You can do this by taking the measurement of the person who will be wearing this garment. Take the measurement of the area of the person\u2019s body the band will go around. This could be the person\u2019s waist, chest, wrists, or another area that the garment will cover.  For example, if the elastic is part of a shirt cuff, then measure around the person\u2019s wrist or arm where the elastic will go. Use this measurement to determine how much elastic you will need, and cut the elastic to this length.

For example, if you are making a dark brown jacket, then you will most likely want to use another earth tone, such as medium brown, beige, or tan. For a more striking look, try choosing a lining in a contrasting color, such as a red lining for a white jacket or a lime green lining for a hot pink jacket.   ", " Feel the texture of the fabric to see if it is smooth. The lining fabric should be smooth so that it will easily glide over other clothing when the wearer puts the jacket on and takes it off. You can tell if a fabric will make good lining material by touching it and running it across your clothing. If the fabric feels smooth and glides easily over your clothes, then it will likely make a good lining.  Fabrics that make good linings include silk, satin, and acetate. Avoid rough fabrics, such as flannel, wool, and fleece.  ", " Check the care instructions for the fabric. The lining fabric should require the same type of care as the fabric for your jacket. Otherwise, it may be difficult to clean the garment. Check the lining fabric\u2019s care instructions and compare them to the care instructions for the jacket\u2019s outer fabric.  For example, if the lining fabric is dry clean only and the outer fabric of the jacket is machine washable, then the entire jacket would need to be dry cleaned each time it is dirty.

To make sure that the fabric is opaque, hold it up to the light. You should not be able to see objects or light through the fabric if it is opaque.  ", " See how well the fabric moves. Lining fabric should be relatively flexible so that it will move with the garment, rather than bunching up or making the jacket feel stiff. Try moving the fabric to see how easily is moves, such as by waving it in the air and folding it in your hands. If the fabric feels stiff, then it probably won\u2019t make a very good lining.  Avoid heavyweight fabrics, such as wool and linen, which tend to be thicker and less flexible than lightweight fabrics, such as cotton and silk.

Check the package to find this recommendation. However, if the pattern does not include this information, then you can use a simple formula to figure out how much fabric to get. Add together the total length of the front and back of the jacket and the sleeve length. For example, if your jacket pattern will create a jacket that is 30 inches (76\u00a0cm) long in the front and back, and it will have sleeves that are 26 inches (66\u00a0cm) long, then add 30 + 30 +26 for a total of 86 inches (220\u00a0cm).

"]}}, "How to Teach a Child to Sew": {"description": "Sewing is a fun and creative endeavour to take on, especially with your kids.  Children of any age can learn some form of sewing that can get them on the path to eventually making their own complex projects and clothing.  The key to teaching a child to sew is to be patient, especially if you are an accomplished sewer yourself.  Allow your child to make mistakes to learn from, but also make sure to teach them the proper techniques along the way.  Most importantly \u2014 have fun!", "content": {"Understanding the Logistics": [" Know what age kids can start to sew. Age, in general, doesn\u2019t matter.  What matters is motivation.  If you\u2019re child shows an interest in learning how to sew, this is the indicator that they might be ready to start learning.  Some sewing instructors, however, recommend waiting till your child is around 6 years of age before introducing them to a sewing machine.  Prior to this, hand sewing is the best option. Because hand coordination is required for sewing, another indication of whether your child is ready can be based on hand-eye coordination.   ", " Allow kids to use the sewing machine. Sewing machines can be a little intimidating for first time sewers.  As with sewing in general, the best indication of whether your child is ready for work on a sewing machine is their interest in the machine.  While it may seem like a good idea to buy a sewing machine specifically for children, these machines are normally of a very low quality and will easily break.  There is no reason why a child cannot use a \u2018real\u2019 sewing machine from the start.  Remember to start off any lesson on the sewing machine with a \u2018safety talk\u2019 so your child understands where to and not to put their hands. One possible way to start a child on a sewing machine is to allow the child to work the pedal, while you control the fabric.  This will allow the child to feel a part of the process, without being scared of having fingers near the needle.  Once more comfortable, you can allow your child to take over control of the fabric as well.  ", " Instruct that speed doesn\u2019t equal quality. When using a sewing machine it is often tempting for the child to \u2018put the pedal to the metal\u2019 and sew really fast.  Unfortunately not only can this cause injury to little hands, it is incredibly difficult to control the direction of the fabric when going this fast.  Teach your child that the best way to sew is slowly and carefully.  The \u2018slowly\u2019 tip also works for hand sewing.  While kids can only sew as fast as their hands can move, there is no need to rush hand sewing.  If it takes all day to sew a square \u2014 that\u2019s okay.  It is better that they feel good with their accomplishment rather than needing to make several corrections because they went too fast.  ", " Have kids pick the pattern, fabric, notions, thread, etc. Allow your child to pick every aspect of the sewing project to be undertaken.  This may mean odd combinations of fabric and colours, but that\u2019s okay.  The sewing project should be about the child, and making sewing fun and exciting.  Kids are more likely to enjoy the project if they feel they were apart of all the decisions.  One exception to this \u2018rule\u2019 is to provide advice if your child wants to use a pattern that is really complicated (e.g. a shirt) or a fabric that is difficult to work with (e.g. velvet).  You don\u2019t want to set your child up for failure, so you may need to encourage an alternative in this situation.  ", " Let kids sew the same thing over and over. Once kids have found a pattern they like, and they\u2019re able to sew the project with great success, they may want to sew the same project over and over (and over and over).  Having them grow really comfortable with a specific pattern is great as it will boost their confidence.  As your child is sewing the same project again, suggest they change something up.  Add a different feature, or a different colour combination, etc. One small and simple project can actually teach kids a large variety of sewing skills that will help them with every new project they take on.  ", " Change the pattern paper. Most professional patterns are made on very thin and flimsy tissue paper.  While they type of paper is fine for adults, it can be really frustrating for kids to work with.  Instead of using the tissue paper, trace the pattern onto thick paper or cardboard for your child to use. Thick card stock paper may work, as well as the cardboard cereal boxes are made from.  Instead of pinning the pattern to the fabric (as you would with the tissue paper), simply have your child trace the pattern onto the fabric with a fabric pencil.  Cutting around a pinned pattern is not easy, even for more experienced sewers.  Tracing the pattern directly onto the fabric will make it easier for your child to cut it out properly.  ", " Draw \u2018real\u2019 lines on the fabric for guidance. When experienced sewers are sewing pieces of fabric together, they know they have to keep their stitching \u00bc\u201d or so from the edge of the fabric.  The line that needs to be sewn along is, technically, invisible.  For an older child or an adult, this is an easy concept to master.  For a young child, this can be really confusing.  Instead of telling kids to follow an imaginary line while they sew, use a fabric pencil and draw the line they need to stitch along directly onto the fabric.  ", " Demonstrate how to put the pattern on the fabric. Normally, when laying the pattern pieces out on a piece of fabric, you want to cover as much of the fabric as possible so you don\u2019t waste any.  Kids, however, may find it more fun to start by cutting pattern pieces out of the middle of a piece of fabric, making it harder to use the fabric again later.  Demonstrate to your child how to lay out all the pattern pieces so you maximize your use of the fabric.  Encourage them to do the same.  Indicate that more projects can be made if less fabric is wasted!  ", " Select thicker thread for hand sewing projects. One of the hardest parts of hand sewing is getting the end of a piece of thread through the eye of a needle!  To help alleviate this frustration with your child, use embroidery needles and thicker thread instead of the \u2018normal\u2019 stuff.  Thicker thread could include the thread used for hand-quilting or upholstery.  \u2018Regular\u2019 thread is quite thin and can tangle very easily. An embroidery needle \u2014 around size 5 \u2014 works best.  The eye of this needle is easier to see and thread.  "], "Sewing Projects for Toddlers": [" Get the right materials. To help toddlers get the hang of stitching and sewing, there is a simple project you can try with them that uses a lot of things you already have around your house.  You\u2019ll need the following: a piece of cardboard; mesh from a bag of potatoes, citrus fruit, etc.; a stapler, a pair of scissors and an Exacto knife; an embroidery needle with a blunt tip; and thick embroidery thread or yarn.  ", " Cut the cardboard and mesh. The mesh will essentially be used as your toddler\u2019s sewing surface, and the cardboard is used to stabilize the mesh as a frame.  The setup is very similar to a cross-stitch frame and fabric.  Therefore you can cut the cardboard and mesh any size that works for you and your toddler.  Attach the mesh to the cardboard using the stapler. You want the mesh to be approximately 1.5\u201d longer and wider than the cardboard frame. Pull the mesh taught over the cardboard so it\u2019s not too flexible in the frame.  ", " Thread the needle. You may need to thread the needle for your toddler, even though the eye is quite large.  Once you have the needle threaded, show them how to stitch in and out of the mesh squares.  Change-up the colour of the thread (or yarn) every so often.  Once you show your toddler how to stitch, let them go at it however they want.  Don\u2019t worry about \u2018normal\u2019 sewing rules. If they want, you can use a marker to draw a pattern on the mesh for your toddler to follow.  ", " Make a string of beads. While not a exactly a sewing project, stringing beads will help a toddler with their hand-eye coordination.  Plus the motion of stringing beads is almost the same as threading a needle, so this skill will be useful should they want to sew in the future.  Making a string of beads is incredibly simple.  For the \u2018string\u2019 you can use plastic gimp, yarn, or thick thread.  The beads can be any type that you find at a craft or fabric store.  The younger the child, the bigger the beads should be.  You can even use buttons instead of beads. Demonstrate how to put the beads on the string, then allow your toddler to take over. The resulting string of beads can be used for just about anything: bracelet, necklace, bookmark, keychain, etc.  "], "Trying Hand Sewing First": [" Teach kids how to thread a needle. For practice purposes, cut a piece of thread about 2 feet (0.6\u00a0m) long.  Thread one side through the eye of the needle.  Pull the thread through the needle until both ends are beside each other.  Put 1-2 knots in the end of the thread, about 1\u201d up from the end.  For visualization purposes, you should be able to hold up the entire length of thread, with one end in each of your hands, and the needle should dangle in the very middle of the piece of thread.  You can then bring the two ends together to tie the knot.  The knot will be at the opposite end of where the needle will dangle.  ", " Get some practice fabric. In order to practice hand sewing, get two pieces of scrap fabric and put them together.  Your child will use these pieces to practice stitching.  This fabric doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, but it should probably be a type of fabric you\u2019ll use often, such as cotton.  One type of practice stitching could be to sew along the edge of the fabric, so make sure that at least one side of your scrap pieces line up to each other.  If necessary, cut the fabric along one edge so it lines up. You may want to select fabric and thread that are two very different colours.  This way your child can easily see the stitches made on the fabric.  ", " Practice different stitches. Start by having your child practice stitching a straight line along the edge of the fabric.  Encourage them to keep each stitch the same size, and keep all the stitches in a straight line without going off the end of the fabric.  Continue having your child practice stitches until they\u2019re able to get a good straight line with even-sized stitches.  The end result may be one or more sets of scrap fabric with all sorts of crazy and uneven stitches in them.  But the point is to allow your child to get the hang of hand sewing with practice.  Using this method will also allow your child to see improvement between each attempt.  ", " Complete some other practice hand sewing projects. Another potential way to practice hand sewing is to use styrofoam plates and colourful embroidery thread.  This form of practice may be better for very young children (less than 6 years old).  They can also sew neat patterns onto the plates with different colours and put them on display.  The styrofoam plates stay stiff while kids are sewing, helping them get the hang of the stitches without getting frustrated with fabric.  The styrofoam is also easy to poke a dull-ended needle through. For this type of practice you can use tapestry needles as they have large eyes and dull ends.  This will help your child get use to threading a needle without accidentally poking themselves with the needle. You can start by having your child get use to pulling the needle in and out of the plate to make stitches.  Then work from there and have them stitch straight lines or objects (e.g. stars, letters, flowers, etc.).  You can even draw the shape onto the plate with a pen first so your child has something to follow.  "], "Completing a No-Sew Sewing Project": [" Buy the materials. For this project the materials are simple \u2014 you\u2019ll need a 14\u201d by 14\u201d pillow form and two pieces of fleece that are at least 16.5\u201d by 16.5\u201d.  You will also need a good pair of sewing scissors.  ", " Cut the fleece. Each square of fleece has to be at least 16.5\u201d by 16.5\u201d.  Because the pillow form is 14\u201d wide, the additional 2.5\u201d will be used to cut strips to tie the two pieces of fleece together.  If you want strips longer than 2.5\u201d, just cut the fleece larger than 16.5\u201d by 16.5\u201d.  Once the two squares are cut, cut strips out of all four sides that will be 1\u201d wide and 2.5\u201d long.  ", " Tie the fleece together. Make sure the two pieces of fleece are on top of each other, with the \u2018right' sides of the fleece facing outwards.  (Most fleece doesn\u2019t have a good and bad side, so it may not matter.)  Starting on one side, start knotting one strip from the top piece of fleece to one strip from the bottom piece of fleece.  Use a double knot.  Complete knotting 3 of the 4 sides of the pillow case.  ", " Put the pillow form inside the fleece. Once 3 of the 4 sides are knotted together, slide the pillow form inside the fleece pillow case.  Once it\u2019s inside, knot the 4th side of the pillow case strips together, also using double knots.  ", " Enjoy your pillow. This project is super-easy and can be completed by kids of just about any age.  If the kids are too young, you may need to do the cutting for them, but even young kids can practice tying knots.  Plus, you can buy pillow forms of any size as long as you also buy fabric that is 2.5\u201d longer on each side for the knots.

Many kids\u2019 craft websites have sewing sheets you can download and print at home.  These sheets have a variety of different patterns on them for your child to follow using a sewing machine.  Print several sewing sheets for your child and go to the sewing machine.  These sheets have a variety of fun patterns like mazes and dot-to-dot patterns.  The purpose is to teach your child how to control the sewing machine BEFORE you put thread in it.  ", " Show the basic sewing machine functions. Once at the sewing machine, show your child the following: how to raise and lower the needle/foot; how to use the pedal to make the needle move; how to use the manual dial to move the needle; and how to guide the paper while the needle moves.  Once your child has a handle on the straight-forward functions of the machine, use the patterns you printed to practice these various functions. All that is happening is that the paper is having tiny holes punched in it from the needle.  No thread is being used. Use these practice sheets to show your child how to do a pivot stitch around a corner (where the needle stays down, but you turn the paper in a new direction).  ", " Practice with thread. Once your child has the hang of the basic functions of the sewing machine without thread, it\u2019s time to add the thread.  Start with a folded piece of fabric and a regular-sized straight stitch on the machine.  Demonstrate the differences with the functions your child has already learned now that there is thread involved.  It might be too early to demonstrate how to thread the machine and create a bobbin, so you may just want to do this on your own. Show your child how to line up the edge of the fabric with the edge of the lowered foot.  This allows the stitching to be about \u00bc\u201d from the edge of the fabric.  If it helps, you can draw this line directly onto the fabric for your child to follow. Show your child how to lower the needle into the fabric before touching the pedal.  You should instruct your child that the needle must always be all the way down before pressing the pedal. Practice pressing the pedal slowly and lightly to start the needle.  Show them how to use the back button to do a backstitch over top of the forward stitches already in place. Practice anchoring the stitching by using the backstitch (which should always be done at the start and end of every line of stitching). Continue practicing along the edge of the fabric, including pivoting around corners. When finished a line of stitching, remember to anchor the end of the stitching.  Demonstrate how to use the wheel to raise the needle all the way up, and then raise the foot off the fabric. Finally, show your child how to pull the fabric away from the machine and cut the thread.  ", " Continue to practice by making a snake charmer. Snake charmers are a very simple project that can be made on a sewing machine.  This project doesn\u2019t require an actual pattern, it just uses measurements.

You can simply follow the pattern\u2019s instructions for how much fabric to buy and use the pattern pieces to cut and sew the fabric. Look for a beginner level pattern if this is the first time you are making a cloak. You can find a pattern in a craft supply store, or you can find free patterns online.  The pattern package should have a list of the items you will need to make the cloak. Use this as your guide when purchasing your fabric and notions, such as the clasp and thread.   ", " Select a durable fabric for the outside of the cloak. Cotton and broadcloth work well for the exterior of a cloak if you want it to be lightweight. If you want something heavier, then you can use wool or linen. If you plan to wear the cloak outdoors, then make sure the fabric you choose will hold up against the elements, such as a waterproof nylon or vinyl fabric. Make sure that the fabric you choose moves easily. Hold a piece in your hand and try to wave it around. If it is stiff, then it probably won\u2019t work well for a cloak.

To save money, you can use cotton or broadcloth for the interior. They won\u2019t be as smooth, but they are much cheaper.  ", " Choose matching or contrasting colors for your cloak. The exterior fabric of the cloak will always be visible, but the interior will only be visible when you flourish the cloak, open it up, or take it off. Still, having a little pop of color on the inside of the cloak is a nice touch, or you can go with an interior fabric that will match the exterior for a more subtle look. For example, go with a black fabric for the exterior, and a black fabric on the interior for something subtle. Or, use black fabric for the outside of the cloak, and red, green, purple, or some other color for the interior for a pop of color.  ", " Pick out a clasp or other closure piece for the front clasp. Most cloaks are secured at the neck with just 1 hook clasp or some other type of closure piece. The pattern you use should specify what type of closure piece you will need to secure the cloak.

For example, if the webbing is gray, then opt for a gray thread.  ", " Change your sewing machine needle to a heavy-duty universal needle. It is a good idea to install a new sewing machine needle before sewing webbing to ensure that the needle is sharp enough to penetrate the thick fabric. A heavy-duty universal needle works best for sewing webbing. Follow your sewing machine\u2019s instructions for how to install a new needle.  A size 90/14 or 100/16 needle works well for heavy fabrics, while a 110/18 or 120/19 works well for extra heavy fabrics.   ", " Set your sewing machine to the zigzag stitch .

You will also need this measurement when it is time to cut the fabric for the pant length, so be sure to write it down.  For example, if your measurement is 75\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in), then double it for a total of 150\u00a0cm (59\u00a0in). Then, add 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) for a final total of 170\u00a0cm (67\u00a0in). This is equal to about 1.85\u00a0yd (1.69\u00a0m), so you would need to round up and plan to purchase 2\u00a0yd (1.8\u00a0m) of fabric.   ", " Purchase your required amount of a fabric that is loose and gauzy. Harem pants should feel loose and move well when you walk and dance in them. Opt for a fabric that is lightweight and flexible.

Go with a solid color, a print, or a fabric that has been embellished, such as with sequins.  ", " Choose wide elastic for the waist and narrow elastic for the ankles. The waist elastic should be about 2 to 2.5\u00a0cm (0.79 to 0.98\u00a0in) wide and the ankle elastic should be about 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) wide. Purchase enough of the wide elastic to fit around your waist with a 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) allowance and enough of the narrow elastic to fit around each of your ankles plus an extra 4\u00a0cm (1.6\u00a0in).

Repeat the same process on the opposite side of the fabric to create an identical curve. Use the mark you made to help you position the shorts. Then, trace along the curve the same way that you did for the other side.  Keep in mind that the second curve will be going in the opposite direction of the first curve, but the 2 curves will match up perfectly when you fold the edges of the fabric together.  ", " Measure from the fold to find your desired pant length plus 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in). Use the waist to floor pant length measurement that you found earlier. Then, add 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in) to it for seam allowance. Measure from the fold and mark the fabric with the measurement in a few places. Use the marks to draw a line across the fabric with a fabric marker or a piece of chalk.

Depending on the other materials that spandex is blended with, it may shrink the first time you wash it. To prevent your finished garment from shrinking when you wash it, it is best to wash the fabric before you sew it. Check the instructions for your fabric because different blends of spandex require different types of washing and drying.  For example, if you are using a knit-spandex blend or a blend of spandex and microfiber, linen, or cotton, then you can wash the fabric with warm water and then dry it on low. For silk/spandex blends, hand wash the fabric with cool water and then hang it to air dry. For wool/spandex blends, take the fabric to the dry cleaners.

Make sure that you use a sharp pair of scissors or a sharp rotary cutter to cut out your pattern pieces for sewing.  If you are going to use a rotary cutter, then place the fabric on a cutting mat first. You can purchase cutting mats especially for cutting fabric at craft stores.  ", " Pin with ballpoint pins to avoid damaging the fabric. Ballpoint pins have rounded tips so that they will not sever the threads in the fabrics you stick them through. Instead, the ballpoint pins slide in between the fibers. However, it is still a good idea to place the pins along the seam allowances. This way the holes will not be visible if you do end up damaging the fabric.  ", " Make sure the stretchiest part of the fabric is going around the body. When pinning and sewing a garment with spandex, make sure that you position the stretchiest part of the fabric so that it is wrapping around the body. Spandex fabric comes in 2 way and 4 way stretch. A 2 way stretch fabric will only stretch horizontally, but a 4 way stretch fabric will stretch horizontally and vertically. Before you sew with spandex, use your hands to tug at the fabric and find out which way it stretches.  "], "Sewing Spandex Fabric": [" Install a ballpoint needle in your sewing machine. Regular needles may cut through the spandex fibers and result in damaged fabric. Ballpoint needles have rounded tips so they will go in between the fibers when you sew, so this type of needle is much less likely to damage your fabric.  See your sewing machine\u2019s instructions for how to install a new needle.  ", " Adjust the presser foot so that the pressure is set to 1. Too much pressure on the presser foot of your machine will pull on the fabric as you sew it. This can result in puckered areas along the seam. To reduce the chance of puckered stitches, reduce the pressure on the presser foot. Set your machine\u2019s presser foot pressure to 1 before you begin sewing.  Check your sewing machine\u2019s manual to find out how to change the presser foot pressure.  ", " Thread your machine with an all-purpose polyester thread. It is not necessary to use a special stretchy thread for spandex because you will be using a stitch setting that allows the fabric to stretch.

Set your machine to the zigzag stitch and adjust the stitch length to 0.5 millimetres (0.020\u00a0in). If your fabric is a blend that is not too stretchy, then you may adjust the zigzag stitch to a longer length, such as 1.5 millimetres (0.059\u00a0in). However, it is important to keep the zigzag stitch within the range of 0.5 millimetres (0.020\u00a0in) to 1.5 millimetres (0.059\u00a0in) so that the seams will stretch with the fabric.

Then, use sharp scissors to cut all of the paper pattern pieces along the same size lines.  To ensure that you cut out the right size for all pieces, you may want to trace along the size lines with a red pencil or highlighter before you cut them.  Most patterns will instruct you to cut out between 6 and 12 different pieces to sew your robe. Make sure that you cut out all of the required pieces!  ", " Fold the fabric according to the pattern instructions. Folding the fabric properly is necessary to ensure that you have all the required pieces to sew the robe. Usually, you will be instructed to fold the fabric in half so that the raw edges of your fabric are lined up.  For example, you may need to cut one or more of the pieces along the fold of your fabric to create a larger piece, such as for the back of the robe or sleeves. You may be able to cut out other pieces from any area of the fabric, such as for the robe\u2019s front panels or sash.  ", " Pin the paper pieces to the fabric as indicated by the pattern. When you have your fabric folded as indicated by the pattern, lay each of your paper pieces on the fabric. Sewing patterns will often feature a map of how to arrange the pieces. Use this as your guide. Once you have fit all of the pieces on the fabric, pin them into place by inserting straight pins through the edges of the paper pieces and both layers of fabric.  Use pins with rounded ends so that they don\u2019t go all the way through the fabric and get lost.  Your pattern instructions may indicate a different layout for fabric that is 45 inches (110\u00a0cm) wide versus fabric that is 60 inches (150\u00a0cm) wide.  Be sure to use the correct map for your fabric\u2019s width.  ", " Cut the fabric along the edges of the pattern pieces. Once the pieces are secured, cut along the outer edges of the pattern pieces. Make sure to cut out any notches as indicated on the paper pattern pieces as well. These are essential for properly lining up your robe pieces.  Do not cut any of the folded areas if the pattern has indicated that you should line the piece up with a fold. It is important to keep these larger pieces intact.

If you don't have a rotary cutter, you can still use a pair of scissors or shears. These just might not give as neat of an edge.  ", " Use clips to join layers of the clear vinyl. Since you may want to sew layers of clear vinyl or stack it on fabric, it's useful to keep the layers in place. Instead of sticking pins into the vinyl which can leave holes, use fabric clips, paperclips, or clothespins. Clips can stop the vinyl from sliding around as you stitch.  Keep in mind that if you do have small holes in the clear vinyl, they can quickly become larger and tear the material.  ", " Cut decorative edges or sew fabric edges to your project. Although the clear vinyl won't fray, you may want to finish the edges to give your project a professional look.

Do not use polyester batting.  Depending on the thickness of the insulation fabric, you may need more than 1 layer per side of the oven mitts. Compare the thickness of the fabric to the thickness of a pair of pre-made oven mitts, or just double the insulating fabric if you are unsure. It is better to have too much insulation than not enough.  ", " Get 0.25\u00a0yd (0.23\u00a0m) of double fold bias tape to accent the oven mitts. You will have some raw edges to cover around the opening of your oven mitts. Bias tape is ideal for this part of sewing oven mitts. You can purchase bias tape in many different colors and prints.

Once you've chosen a zipper, measure its total length. This should include the small bit of fabric on the ends of the zipper pull. The total length of the zipper will be the length of your pouch.  For example, you might buy a 9\u00a0in (23\u00a0cm) zipper, but once you measure the fabric ends, it will be inches (27\u00a0cm) long. This means the fabrics for your pouch need to be inches (27\u00a0cm) long.  ", " Make the width for the pouch as wide as you like. For a narrow pouch that might hold something thin like pencils, measure the width of the fabric to be 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6\u00a0cm). If you want a wide pouch that could hold makeup, toys, or diapers, measure the fabric to be around inches (17\u00a0cm).  ", " Use fabric shears to cut 4 equal-size pieces of fabric. Now that you know how long and wide you want the pouch to be, cut 2 outer pieces of fabric and 2 pieces of fabric for the lining. Each piece should be the same size.

Then straight stitch up towards the zipper pull, but stop about inch (1.3\u00a0cm) before reaching the zipper pull. Stop and unzip the zipper before you finish stitching the line.  If your zipper pull is small and doesn't bulge out to the side, you can straight stitch from end to end without stopping.  ", " Open the fabric layers and iron them on low heat. Lay the fabric on your work surface so the layers are open like a book. The zipper should be facing up and be in the center. You'll see the outer layers of fabric facing up on both sides of the zipper with the liner pieces underneath them. Then run your iron over the fabric to smooth the layers.

However, sewing fake leather comes with some special challenges of its own. You cannot pin and cut fake leather the same way that you would with most fabrics. You need to adjust your sewing machine before sewing fake leather. There are also some special tools and techniques you can try to get the best results possible!", "content": {"Cutting Fake Leather": [" Place weights on top of the pattern pieces before you cut the fabric. If you are using a pattern to sew fake leather, you will need to use the pieces as your guides for cutting. To avoid damaging fake leather fabric, use paper weights to hold the pattern pieces in place on top of the fake leather fabric. You can use paper weights, clean rocks, or any other small, heavy item to hold the pattern pieces in place.  Make sure that you use plenty of weights to hold down all of the edges of the pattern pieces. Place a weight every 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2\u00a0cm) along the edges of the pattern pieces.   ", " Cut fake leather with a rotary cutter and cutting mat. It is important to have a sharp tool to cut fake leather since it tends to be thick. Place the leather on a plastic cutting mat and use a rotary cutting tool to cut the fake leather along the edges of the pattern.  You use a rotary cutting tool similar to how you would cut a pizza. Hold the rotary tool by the handle and roll the blade over the areas of the fake leather fabric you want to cut. If you do not have a rotary cutting tool, then you can use a pair of very sharp scissors. Just be careful not to move the weights when you cut the fabric. Hold the scissors close to the table or other surface that the fake leather is resting on.  ", " Use binder clips to hold the cut fake leather pieces together. After you cut the fake leather into the shapes required for your sewing pattern, use binder clips to connect the pieces as indicated by the pattern. Binder clips will not penetrate the fabric the way that pins will, so you will be less likely to damage the fabric.  Place a binder clip about every 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6\u00a0cm) along the edges of the fabric pieces. You will need to remove the binder clips before you sew each area of the fake leather.  ", "Iron the seams using the synthetic setting. Ironing down folded edges of the fake leather fabric before you sew them may help to make it easier to sew fake leather fabric. If your iron has a synthetic setting, set it to that. You should also place a t-shirt or thin towel over the fake leather fabric before you sew.  If your iron does not have a synthetic setting, then use the lowest possible setting.  ", " Plan where you will sew and sew only once across an area. Fake leather material will tear if you sew over it too many times, so it is best to only sew across an area of the fabric 1 time. Identify where you want your stitches to go before you start sewing.  Try using chalk to mark the areas where you want to stitch the fake leather. Do not backstitch with fake leather. Even this small amount of extra stitching can weaken the fabric.  ", " Sew to the end of the fabric and tie the thread in a knot. When you have reached the final edge of your leather fabric, sew all the way to the end of the fabric and off the edge. Then, cut the thread with several inches of excess thread remaining and tie the ends of the thread together twice to secure the last stitch.

The stitch will cover more area of the fake leather fabric, so it will hold the edge of the fabric more securely. If you prefer the look of the zigzag stitch, use it to sew your hems.  Consult your sewing machine for instructions on how to set it to the zigzag stitch.  ", " Widen the stitch length to at least 3.5. Having the stitches too close together may stress the fabric and lead to tears. A wider stitch length will help to prevent the needle from damaging your fake leather fabric. Locate the stitch width dial or control button on your sewing machine and adjust the stitch length so that it is on one of the wider settings, 3.5 or higher.  Consult your sewing machine\u2019s manual for specific instructions on how to adjust the stitch width.  ", " Loosen the tension on your thread to make it easier to sew. Too much tension on your thread can make it difficult to sew through fake leather fabric, and you may also end up breaking your thread. To make it easier to sew the fake leather fabric, adjust the thread tension on your sewing machine by turning the dial at the top of the machine near the area where the thread feeds through. Turn the dial to the left by about 1 quarter to 1 half of a turn to loosen the thread.  Test the stitches on a piece of scrap fabric to see if you need to adjust the tension more. If the thread bunches up on the back of the fabric, you have loosened the tension too much.  "], "Making Fake Leather Easier to Sew": [" Install a new needle before and after sewing fake leather. The thickness of this fabric will wear down the point of your sewing machine needle more quickly than other fabrics, so it is important to install a new needle before you start a sewing project that uses fake leather and after you finish the project as well.  Follow your sewing machine\u2019s instructions for installing a new needle.  ", " Use a denim sewing machine needle with a thicker fake leather fabric. Depending on the thickness of your fake leather, it may be hard for a standard sewing machine needle to get through it. Using a standard needle with extra thick fake leather may even damage your machine or cause the needle to break. Purchase a denim sewing machine needle for use with thicker fabrics to make this easier.  There are sewing machine needles meant for sewing leather, but a denim needle will work better with fake leather.  ", " Thread the sewing machine with a heavy-duty thread. To ensure strong stitches in fake leather fabric, make sure to use thread that is thick enough to hold the leather fabric together. You can purchase a thread meant for working thicker materials, such as denim thread or embroidery thread.  The color of the thread should also match the fake leather fabric. For example, if the fabric is brown, then choose a brown thread.  ", " Purchase a non-stick presser foot. Fake leather may stick to a standard metal presser foot. To help the presser foot glide over the fabric, use a presser foot that is coated with Teflon or a roller presser foot.  Check your local craft supply store for a non-stick presser foot. Follow your machine's instructions for installing the presser foot.  ", " Use parchment or wax paper to help the presser foot glide.

You can also check the fabric store for needles designed for sewing denim. These should be strong enough to work with oilcloth.   ", " Use polyester thread in your favorite color. If you want your project to have a waterproof quality, use polyester thread that won't absorb moisture. You can choose a thread color that matches the fabric so it blends in, or pick a color that stands out. For example, bright green or red thread really pops against black oilcloth.  If you're not concerned about having waterproof qualities, you could also use standard cotton thread.  ", " Adjust your straight stitch between 3.0 and 3.5 mm. Since it's easiest to use oilcloth with basic shapes such as squares or rectangles, use a straight stitch. To avoid punching too many holes in the oilcloth, use a longer stitch than you usually would. For example, adjust the machine for a 3.0 to 3.5 mm stitch.  If you do plan on stitching curves, consider decreasing the length of the stitch between 2.5 and 3 mm.  ", " Use a teflon presser foot to prevent the oilcloth from sticking. Since a standard metal presser foot may stick to the oilcloth, remove it and pop a teflon presser foot in place. You can buy a plastic teflon presser foot at most fabric supply stores. If you can't find them, stick a little masking tape on the bottom of the presser foot so it slides over the oilcloth.  If you're still struggling to get the presser foot to glide, turn the fabric over so you're stitching the back of the oilcloth. This will make it easier to feed the fabric through the machine.  "], "Stitching the Oilcloth": [" Lay out the oilcloth for a few hours to remove the wrinkles. If your oilcloth was folded or came in a box, it will be creased when you lay lay it flat. To remove the wrinkles without damaging the oilcloth, lay it out for a few hours in a warm room. The wrinkles should disappear once the fabric warms a little.  If it's sunny and warm outside, you can lay the oilcloth outdoors. Don't use an iron to smooth the oilcloth or you could damage the fabric.  ", " Choose a pattern for your oilcloth. Baby items such as bibs, mess mats, and diaper bags are popular projects to make with oilcloth. You can also find patterns at fabric stores or online for common kitchen items such as aprons, place mats, shelf liners, and tablecloths. For other oilcloth items around the house, make:  Book covers Pen or crayon cases Outdoor throw pillows Lunch sacks Shopping cart seat covers  ", " Cut the fabric and sew it according to your pattern. Use standard shears or scissors to cut the oilcloth according to the pattern you chose. Follow the instructions for stitching it using your sewing machine. Because oilcloth is so thick and sturdy, avoid sewing it by hand.  ", " Use clips when joining layers of oilcloth. If your pattern calls for stitching layers of oilcloth together, it's helpful to hold them in place. Use fabric clips, paperclips, binder clips, or clothespins to prevent the fabric from moving as you sew.  Avoid using pins because these will poke holes in the fabric. The holes will make the fabric more likely to tear and will compromise its waterproof quality.  ", " Finish the edges, if desired. Since the edges of oilcloth won't fray, you don't have to hem or finish the edges. If you'd like a decorative look, finish the edges by cutting them with pinking shears or decorative scissors.

For a flapper-style dress, arrange rows of fringe over the entire surface of the dress. If you just want a little movement, just lay a few rows near the hemline.  ", " Secure each row of fringe in place with sewing pins. Once you've arranged the fringe where you want it, take sewing pins and insert them horizontally through the fringe heading and into the fabric of the dress. This prevents the fringe from sliding around as you sew it.  Unlike most sewing projects, keep the dress turned right-side out so the fringe ends up on the outside of the dress. Remember to turn the dress over to pin the fringe around the entire circumference of the dress.  ", " Straight stitch or zigzag stitch the heading of the fringe to the dress. Program your sewing machine to make straight stitches if the dress fabric is non-stretch. If it's stretchy, use a zigzag stitch. Make a few stitches before backstitching 2 or 3 stitches.

A new needle will help to prevent damage from a dull needle. It\u2019s important to use the smallest possible needle when sewing chiffon as this will help to prevent damage to the fabric. Remove the old needle that\u2019s installed on your machine and replace it with the new one.  Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for how to remove and install a new needle on your sewing machine. Always turn off your sewing machine and unplug it before installing a new needle.  ", " Use a matching color fine-weight or all-purpose thread. Try to match the color of your chiffon as closely as possible, such as by using light pink thread with light pink chiffon. You may opt for an all-purpose thread, or go with a fine-weight thread, such as silk thread, if you\u2019d like something more delicate for the seams.  ", " Sew a straight stitch through the chiffon and tissue paper. Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting and position your fabric under the presser foot with the tissue paper underneath it. Sew slowly and keep the stitch about in (1.6\u00a0cm) from the raw edge of the fabric.  The tissue paper will make it easier to feed the fabric through your sewing machine and help to prevent snags. Avoid backstitching whenever you sew with chiffon. When you reach an edge, sew right off of it and leave the end threads about 6\u00a0in (15\u00a0cm) long when you cut them.   ", " Tear off the tissue paper when you finish sewing. Once you have completed the seam, use your hands to rip the tissue paper away from the chiffon at the seams. The tissue paper will come off easily since it is thin. Discard the used paper or save it to reuse if it\u2019s still mostly intact.  If you taped a portion of the tissue paper, cut along these edges with a pair of fabric scissors instead of ripping them.  ", " Tie any loose thread ends by hand. Grasp the loose threads at the end of a seam and tie them together in a knot. Then tie 2 more knots with the threads to secure them. Cut the excess thread about in (0.64\u00a0cm) from the last knot.  ", " Zigzag stitch along the raw edges of the fabric to prevent it from fraying. Chiffon frays easily, but sewing an additional stitch along the raw edge can help to prevent this. Set your sewing machine to the zigzag setting and sew a zigzag stitch along each of the raw edges individually. Do not sew the 2 raw edges along a seam together.  ", " Open and press the seams with an iron set to low. Lay the fabric out on an ironing board or towel on a counter top. Then, open up the seam so that each raw edge is going in the opposite direction of the one next to it. Run a warm iron along the open seam to press it down flat.  Don\u2019t keep the iron in one place. Move it slowly, but continuously along the seam until you reach the end. You may also want to lay a t-shirt or towel over the fabric to protect it from the heat of the iron, even if you have it on a low heat setting. Pressing the seams will help to give the chiffon a neater finish.  "], "Hemming Chiffon": [" Install a new, size 70/10 or smaller sewing machine needle.

Crease the fabric along the stitch you just made with your fingertips by pressing them along the fold. Make sure that the stitch is right on the folded edge.  If desired, you may also press this fold with an iron on the lowest setting. Move the iron along the stitch line to crease the fabric.  ", " Sew another straight stitch as close to the folded edge as possible. Place the fabric under the sewing machine and sew about in (0.64\u00a0cm) from the folded edge to secure it. Go slowly and sew the stitch parallel to the folded edge.  Don\u2019t backstitch. Sew right off the edge or to the beginning of the seam again. Tie off and cut the excess thread just as you did before.  ", " Cut the excess fabric about in (0.32\u00a0cm) from the stitch.

If you\u2019re new to sewing fleece, there are some special tools, strategies, and tips that can help you to get the best possible results. Once you\u2019ve got your materials ready and your machine set up and ready to go, you can start sewing fleece like a pro!", "content": {"Selecting Materials": [" Select a simple pattern for your first fleece project. Choose something that doesn\u2019t require too many pieces, seams, or advanced fitting techniques, such as pleating. Instead, opt for simple, loose-fitting styles when you want to make a fleece garment. Some simple items you might try making with fleece include:  Blankets Pull-overs Mittens Pajama pants   ", " Choose a polyester thread color that matches or is similar to your fabric. Since fleece is thick, the thread will be hard to see. However, it is still a good idea to choose thread that matches your fabric as closely as possible. If your fleece fabric is a print, opt for thread that matches one of the dominant colors in the fabric.  Don\u2019t use cotton thread when sewing fleece as it doesn\u2019t have much give and may break. Opt for polyester or polyester-wrapped cotton thread instead.   ", " Select a thin cotton or polyester fabric if you want to line fleece garments. Fleece is pretty thick, so you might not need to line it at all. However, if you decide to line your fleece fabric for comfort, style, or stability reasons, don\u2019t use a thick fabric. Use something lightweight and thin, such as cotton or polyester.  ", " Select an anti-pill fleece to ensure durability and quality. Some types of fleece will form pills\u2014little fuzzballs\u2014on the fabric over time. These are unattractive and can be irritating against bare skin as well. To avoid this, look for fleece that is labeled as anti-pill. Other types of fleece you might consider include:  Cotton fleece: soft, knitted, breathable fabric that absorbs moisture. Rayon fleece: smooth, soft, and breathable. Polyester fleece: high-quality, durable, soft, and anti-pill. Hemp fleece: natural fluffy fleece that\u2019s plush on one side and smooth on the other. Bamboo fleece: made from bamboo with a soft texture. Polar fleece: thick synthetic fleece that makes a good lining for jackets and other garments. Faux Sherpa: resembles a fluffy wool material.  ", " Pre-wash your fleece fabric before sewing as it may shrink. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for washing fleece. In general, wash fleece on a normal cycle with warm\u2014not hot\u2014water. Use laundry detergent, but never use bleach or fabric softener.  Avoid drying fleece in a dryer and hang it up to dry whenever possible.  "], "Marking, Cutting, and Sewing": [" Mark the right side of the fabric if the sides look similar. Use chalk, a fabric marker, or a piece of tape to mark the right (outer) side of the fabric. Some types of fleece look the same on both sides, so it can be difficult to tell the difference between them. Marking the fabric will help to ensure that you are sewing the fleece with the correct side facing out.  ", " Secure the pattern pieces on fleece fabric with long pins or weights. Insert the pins through the paper pattern piece and fabric, then back up and through both layers again. Position the pins or weights about in (1.3\u00a0cm) from the edges of the paper pattern pieces.  Short pins can easily get lost in thick fleece fabric, so make sure that you are using extra-long pins or fabric weights to keep your pattern pieces in place as you cut the fabric.  ", " Cut the fabric around the pattern with sharp fabric scissors or a rotary cutter. Fleece is often thick and it can be difficult to cut, but a pair of sharp fabric scissors or a rotary cutter will work well for getting smooth, even cuts. If you use scissors, don\u2019t try to cut it with dull scissors or you may end up with jagged edges. Use a pair of sharp fabric scissors that you only use for cutting fabric.  Make sure to place the fabric onto a cutting mat if you\u2019re using a rotary cutter. Don\u2019t use it on a counter, table, or other surface because the cutter may damage it.  ", " Attach interfacing to the fabric if you need to stabilize the fabric. Sew interfacing along an edge or seam, or apply it to the fabric before sewing by ironing it with a damp cloth over the interfacing and fabric. If you\u2019re not concerned about the fabric maintaining a rigid structure, then you can skip this. However, if you want to ensure that the fabric retains its shape or holds up against tension along a seam, attaching interfacing can be helpful. Some situations where you might want to use interfacing include:  The shoulder areas of fleece garments Zippers and other closures Seams and hems  "], "Setting up Your Sewing Machine": [" Install a new universal or ballpoint needle in your sewing machine. Choose a needle in size 12 (80) for best results. Using a ballpoint needle is optional, but it may help to prevent skipped stitches. This type of needle goes in between the fibers rather than cutting through them, so it can also help to prevent damage.  ", " Set up a walking foot in place of a normal presser foot, if possible. A walking foot can help to prevent your fabric from getting bunched up by moving it along as you sew. If you don\u2019t have a walking foot, you can still sew fleece with your regular presser foot.  If you do use a regular presser foot, expect to sew a little slower and pay close attention to the fabric under the presser foot to ensure that it doesn\u2019t get stuck.  ", " Select the narrowest zigzag stitch setting on your sewing machine. On most sewing machines, this will be 0.5 mm, but you can make it narrower if this is an option. Adjust the setting on your machine using the dial or digital display, depending on what type of machine you have.  Check your sewing machine\u2019s instructions for details on how to change the settings if you are unsure about how to change them.  ", " Set the stitch length to 3.5 mm or longer. A longer stitch length is better for sewing fleece as it provides more give in the seam. Choose at least a 3.5 mm setting, or set the stitch length to a longer length if desired.  You may also want to consult your pattern\u2019s suggestions for what stitch setting to use.  "], "Sewing and Finishing the Fabric": [" Raise the presser foot and position the fabric under the needle. Align the fabric under the needle where you want to sew a hem or seam. Ensure that the fabric is straight and adjust it so that the edge of the fabric is at the right distance from the needle to create the desired seam allowance. Then, lower the presser foot onto the fabric to secure it.  ", " Apply gentle pressure to the pedal to sew slowly. Sewing too quickly may result in mistakes, such as bunched up fabric or thread. Instead, sew the fabric using a very light touch, at least at first. As you get more comfortable sewing fleece, you can increase your pressure on the pedal and sew faster.  ", " Hold the fabric taut as you sew. Pull the edges of the fabric gently in front of and behind the sewing machine. Don\u2019t stretch the fabric, but keep it taut enough so that it doesn\u2019t bunch up under your sewing machine.  If you notice this happening, stop sewing and readjust the fabric.  ", " Trim the edges with pinking shears to prevent fraying. Pinking shears are fabric scissors with jagged edges. Use a pair of pinking shears to cut in a straight line about in (0.64\u00a0cm) from the seam after sewing a fleece garment. Be very careful not to cut through the seam itself.  Most fleece fabric is not prone to fraying, but trimming the edges with pinking shears before you sew will help to ensure that it doesn\u2019t fray. You can also add a stay stitch to prevent fraying along the edges, such as by sewing a zigzag stitch along the edge of a fleece item.

Once you've removed the thread that you know you don't want to keep, separate the thread you're going to save into a current project pile and a future project pile. If you have more than 1 cross stitch project going, make a pile for each. Having all of the thread you need for a project in 1 easy to access space saves you time.  ", " Donate excess thread that you don't want to keep. If you have excess thread that's still in good condition, but you don't like the brand or you know you won't use them, ask local community centers or schools if they can use the thread. These groups can use them for their own classes and craft projects.  ", " Group the thread by color, project, or thread number. Before you choose a storage solution, get an idea of how much thread you have to store. Organize the thread by color, project, or the thread number listed on the thread paper. For example, you might group all of the green thread in a large pile, the purple thread in another pile, etc. If you're sorting by number, you might make a pile of threads between 300 and 400, 400 and 500, and so on.  "], "Winding Thread onto Bobbins": [" Buy bobbins and a bobbin winder. Go to a craft supply or sewing store and buy plastic or cardboard bobbins. You'll need 1 bobbin for each skein of thread that you want to store. Then, buy a handheld bobbin winder tool to make winding easier. If you can't find these supplies at your local craft store, check online. If you don't feel like buying a winder, you can wrap the thread around the bobbin by hand. This works best if you only have a few skeins to wrap.  ", " Snap the winder onto a bobbin box and unwrap a skein of thread. Get out a plastic bobbin box that has individual compartments and snap the base of the bobbin winder onto the side of the open compartment. Then, peel the paper label off of the first skein of thread that you want to wind. You can write the color number directly on the tip of the bobbin or trim the paper label and tape it to the back of the bobbin.  ", " Place the thread around a wide jar and push the bobbin into the winder. Although you can keep the skein of thread loose as you wind it, it may tangle so put it around a sturdy jar or container to keep the threads in place. Take a bobbin and insert it into the bobbin winder. Since the bobbin is secure, there's no need to hold it in place while you're winding.  ", " Thread the end of the thread through the tip of the bobbin and wind it a few times. Pull the end of the thread onto the bobbin and push it through the diagonal slit at the end. This catches the thread so it doesn't come undone. Turn the bobbin winder handle a few times to get the thread started on the bobbin. Ensure that nothing's placed between the thread and the bobbin winder or the thread may catch.  ", " Wind the thread faster to transfer the entire skein to the bobbin. Use one hand to turn the handle while your other hand holds the thread that's being wound. Guide the thread across the bobbin so it winds evenly. It's alright if your bobbin is a little bumpy or uneven, but you may lose storage space if you can't neatly stack them.  ", " Remove the bobbin and store it in the plastic compartment. Tuck the loose end of thread into the other diagonal slit at the end of the bobbin. Then, place it into your storage compartment according to color or number. Wind as many skeins as you like.

If you're short on time and just want a fast way to keep your thread separate, get out a box of sealable bags. Place as many skeins or bobbins of thread as you like into each bag and label the outside of the with the thread's color number. Then, put the bags into plastic totes or shoe boxes. Organize the bags of thread by color, project, or thread number. Keep in mind that if you're placing more than 1 skein of thread into a bag, the thread is more likely to tangle.  ", " Put the skeins into plastic storage cabinets to store lots of thread. Purchase cabinets with shallow drawers from craft supply shops for a lightweight, cheap storage system. Slide out each drawer and fill them with your thread. Then, make a label that tells what's inside each drawer and attach the labels to the front of the cabinet. If you fill an entire cabinet, you can fill another one and stack the cabinets. Avoid stuffing the drawers too full or you won't be able to find the thread you need and the skeins may tangle.  ", " Place thread into a flat storage container with dividers for easy traveling. If you need a portable storage solution for just 1 project, buy a clear container that's divided into small compartments. These are usually sold to store beads, but you can place 1 or 2 skeins or bobbins of thread into each compartment. The divided compartments prevent the thread from sliding around and getting tangled.  ", " Tie skeins of thread from the bottom bar of a hanger to store thread in a closet. Untwist a skein to make a giant loop of thread and find the knot on the loop. Cut through all the threads so you have a long strand and it in half. Place the bottom bar of a hanger over the folded end of the thread. Then, gather the other end of the thread and bring it up through the folded to form a clove hitch knot . You can use a plastic, wooden, or metal hanger to store your thread. Hang 10 to 12 skeins of thread depending on the size of the hanger.

Once it\u2019s cut, place the circle template on the piece of fabric you\u2019re using and trace it using a pen or pencil. The template will be part of the packaging from your button kit, so don\u2019t throw away the packaging once you take out the button kit pieces.   ", " Put the button on your fabric and draw around it to measure without a template. Use a pen or pencil to trace a circle around the button that's roughly 1 centimetre (0.39\u00a0in) past the edge of the button. This extra space ensures the sides of the button will be covered too. This circle will be where you cut. Don't just trace the edges of the button, as this won't leave you enough space to wrap the fabric around the edges of the button. If you're not sure how much space to leave between the button and your drawn circle, measure the diameter of the button. This is the correct amount of space to leave between the button's edge and your pen or pencil markings.  ", " Use scissors to cut along the circle you drew for the button. Once you\u2019ve created your drawn circle, use scissors to cut along the marks you drew. Use sharp scissors, such as fabric scissors, to ensure your fabric doesn\u2019t fray.
